November 10 | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nTucker Beathard  wsg: Aubrie Sellers\nPresented by: 102.9 W4 Country\n\nTucker Beathard - Growing up in a family that excelled at both music and sports \u2014 his father is a hit songwriter; his brothers, star quarterbacks \u2014 Big Machine Label Group recording artist Tucker Beathard has an unrelenting competitive spirit: He wakes up every day trying to write the perfect song. For Tucker, a self-taught guitarist and drummer, there's no such thing as \"good enough.\"   \"I love anything with great melodies and I'm drawn to the little things,\" Tucker says, rattling off his influences with an artist's attention to detail. \"When I listen to Led Zeppelin, I focus on John Bonham's drums. Or Joe Walsh's guitar licks in the Eagles. And Hank Williams Jr.'s 'Family Tradition' is as country songwriting as it gets.\"  Tucker certainly knows something about family tradition, taking cues from dad Casey Beathard, who wrote Kenny Chesney's \"Don't Blink\" and Eric Church's \"Homeboy.\" The latter, in fact, was inspired by Tucker, who admits to going through his own rebellious phase.  Giving up a college baseball scholarship to dive headlong into songwriting, Tucker came out better for his diverse experiences and documented those wild times in the wise-beyond-its-years \"Momma and Jesus.\" The track is one of many in contention for his debut album, being overseen by producer Angelo Petraglia (Kings Of Leon).   With a rhythmic way of playing guitar, influenced by his innate drumming ability, Tucker has created some of contemporary country music's most progressive songs. \"Rock On,\" a song about regretting the girl that got away, is taut in its delivery, with clever turns of phrase. Likewise, \"20-10 Tennessee,\" a standout, uses a football game as metaphor for a relationship and \u201cBetter Than Me\u201d puts a unique spin on an arena-ready breakup anthem, ultimately wishing the best for someone after parting ways.   \"I've always been a huge fan of deep songs, and I've always liked poems,\" he says. \"I'm an introvert, but writing songs that go beneath the surface allows me the chance to open up a piece of myself.\"   As does his engaging live show.  Having played with artists like Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert, Tucker regularly bares his soul in front of a crowd. Despite his reserved demeanor, the stage is where he is most free \u2014 it's his canvas to paint an honest picture of who he is, as both a songwriter and an artist.   \"Expressing yourself onstage and putting your emotion into each song is a feeling that is tough to match. It's your way of letting the world know who you are,\" says Tucker, who has one main goal when performing. \"Whether it's 'My heart is broken' or 'Let's party tonight,' I want people to feel this is a real dude who knows who he is \u2014 and who says it like it is.\"", "date": "2016-11-10T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Tucker Beathard 11/10/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/194317207644560/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "react presents\n\n:: Klingande ::\n\nDoors at 9:00pm\n18+ Welcome\n\nNecto\n516 E.

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\n\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\n\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\n\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal. It\u2019s a transformation record.\u201d We are so pleased to welcome Mary Gauthier into our Series. www.marygauthier.com", "date": "2016-11-12T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Mary Gauthier at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1833327960283103/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "My people!

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "date": "2016-11-17T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/360781184260443/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "date": "2016-11-18T15:00:00-05:00", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1807900772828520/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Art Off The Wall 2016 is the Ann Arbor Art Center's BIGGEST Holiday Exhibition and Shopping Event ever!

This will be a no-drop group ride and is a great chance for novice MTBer's to get exposure to single track riding and be a fun way to burn off that Thanksgiving feast and get a jump start on getting fit for 2017.  The ride will be about 14 miles long covering ~5.5 miles at Hewens Creek and ~6.5 miles at Rolling Hills along with a few miles of dirt road connecting the two parks.  For those who haven't ridden or rarely ride at either trail, Hewens Creek is a flat, winding ride through meadows and new growth forest which is great for beginning riders.  The RHP trail on the other hand twists and turns through 4+ miles of forest and rolling hills that provide a great opportunity to improve your bike handling skills and 2.5+ miles of open meadows.  The 1.2-mile West Meadows loop on the west side of RHP includes beautiful open meadows and some fun pump-track like riding on the Munger Mounds.   \n\nMeet at the Rolling Hills Lodge at 9:45 AM and then we will head out by 10-10:15 AM.  After the ride, we will have some pizza and refreshments at the lodge at about 12:30 PM.  Please register in advance at Event Brite to attend so a good estimate of riders can be made for the pizza and beverages.  Rain date will be Saturday 11/26 at 10 AM.  Look for changes in schedule on the Rolling Hills or Hewens Creek forums on the MMBA website, the Poto Yahoo! Group Email list, the Poto MBA Facebook page or Poto MBA Twitter account.\n\nPlease park in the MTB trail head parking lot:  enter the park, go straight through the traffic circle and park in the first lot on your right next to a big pavilion ~1/4 mile west of the circle.  The Lodge will be about 200 yards away on your left.  \n\nThere will be a gate charge to enter RHP.  It is a Washtenaw County Park so if you already have WCP sticker you are good to go.  Otherwise, park entry will cost $5 for everyone as a discount for non-Washtenaw residents was arranged.\n\nLast but definitely not least, we have to thank DeWight and crew at Wheels in Motion for supporting the MTB community by sponsoring this event and paying for the food and refreshments since its inaugural event in 2009.", "date": "2016-11-25T10:00:00-05:00", "name": "8th Annual Poto MBA Black Friday MTB Ride"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1144162335698642/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "date": "2016-11-25T15:00:00-05:00", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/511083695755016/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nThe League will invite volunteers from the audience to share stories about their holidays \u2013 funny, awkward, sad, or wacky \u2013 and then they will perform scenes inspired by these tales.\n\nGroup 1: Donny & Lisa \nGroup 2: With Wieck\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "date": "2016-11-25T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Holiday Improv Show with Donny & Lisa and With Wieck"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1220895527971258/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Earphorik and Stormy Chromer teaming up for an epic double-headlining show at the Club Above!\n\nDoors 9pm\nStormy Chromer - 9:30-11:00pm\nEarphorik - 11:30pm-end\n18+ // $6 at the door", "date": "2016-11-25T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Earphorik // Stormy Chromer // 11.25.2016 Club Above, Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1291269264238314/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "The Macpodz continue their exploration of sound and Dylan Charles brings his Brooklyn group for a visit to the midwest to perform psychedelic soul", "date": "2016-11-25T21:30:00-05:00", "name": "The Macpodz with On the Sun at the Blind PIg"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1850537738514983/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Our League of Pointless Improvisers will invite audience members and performers to share their Thanksgiving tales, and will then create an improvised show based on these. \nNo two shows are the same! \nTickets are $10.", "date": "2016-11-25T22:00:00-05:00", "name": "A Pointless Display of Improvised Feats \u2013 Thanksgiving Twist"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1168924826486623/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Combining parlor games with the classic social lubricant (alcohol) to multiply their ice busting powers.\n\nWe will supply some low-key interactive games and craft beer. \nBring your friends or make some new ones. \nSaturdays at 4pm.\nPointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "date": "2016-11-26T16:00:00-05:00", "name": "Icebreakers^2"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/254281601641256/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nThe League will invite volunteers from the audience to share stories about their holidays \u2013 funny, awkward, sad, or wacky \u2013 and then they will perform scenes inspired by these tales.\n\nGroup 1: Safe Word \nGroup 2: Lady Parts\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "date": "2016-11-26T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Holiday Improv Show with Safe Word and Lady Parts"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1818934368383393/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nThe League will invite volunteers from the audience to share stories about their holidays \u2013 funny, awkward, sad, or wacky \u2013 and then they will perform scenes inspired by these tales.\n\nGroup 1: Lady Parts \nGroup 2: Safe Word\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "date": "2016-11-26T22:00:00-05:00", "name": "Holiday Improv Show with Lady Parts and Safe Word"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1297908950254482/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "The exhibition Traces focuses on one artwork from UMMA\u2019s African holdings: a Chokwe mask that was collected in 1905 near the Angolan city of Dundo by the German explorer Leo Frobenius.

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound. With support from the likes of Diplo, Omarion, and JoJo, plus tours with artists like Chance the Rapper, Flume and Chet Faker, the producer has clearly caught the eye some of a wide variety of tastemakers. Featured by the likes of Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Boiler Room and The FADER, Cuna has also received admiration from music journalists the world over, drawing almost universal praise from disparate outlets. With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory. And that\u2019s part of the reason why Cuna connects with his fan base on such a visceral level, eschewing traditional industry methods for his own unique, intimate manner of going about business.\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/768", "date": "2016-12-02T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Sweater Beats12/2/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1374253909486568/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Gift Certificates with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get a free $50 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Combo Package \nFor only $75 get a $50 Gift Card and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks \n\nOur Gift Cards and MSV Combo Package can be purchased at our restaurant,\n by calling (888) 456-3463 (DINE), or visit us online at: www.mainstreetventuresinc.com/shop. \n\nTake advantage of this special offer.

While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record.

McBurney transports us into the humid depths of the Amazon, its intense soundscape a new approach to site-specific theater.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/the-encounter/", "date": "2017-04-02T19:30:00-04:00", "name": "The Encounter: Complicite / Simon McBurney"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/192972824428594/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Save these dates to head over to beautiful Buhr Park (unless noted otherwise) and see fast paced, full contact roller derby action from your local league, Ann Arbor Derby Dimes!\n\nMay 14 - June 11 - July 9 - August 6\n\nBUY 2016 SEASON PASSES: http://bpt.me/2537986\n\nJuly 9\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Border City Brawlers: All-Stars\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Border City Brawlers: Canadian Clubbers\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/29dSJv0\nBUY JULY 9 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539693\n\nAugust 6\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Flint City Derby Girls\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Killamazoo Derby Darlins: Kill Squad\nBUY AUGUST 6 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539697\n\nFor more information, see our 2016 season schedule: http://a2derbydimes.org/2016-schedule\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\nPreviously this season:\n\nMay 14\nBrawlstars vs The Chicago Outfit: Syndicate\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs East Lansing Roller Derby: Broadbarians\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/1reSK5y\nBUY MAY 14 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2537998\n\nJune 11\nBrawlstars vs North Star Roller Girls: Supernovas\nArbor Bruising Co. vs North Star Roller Girls: Northern Lights\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/29dSikp\nBUY JUNE 11 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2538000", "date": "2017-04-04T17:00:00-04:00", "name": "Ann Arbor Derby Dimes 2016 season"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/550917835118430/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "New music from a preeminent Atlanta songwriter", "date": "2017-04-07T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Shawn Mullins"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/309991802717749/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "\"Shane Koyczan is at the heart of a Category Five creative hurricane.\"\u2014Vancouver Sun", "date": "2017-04-11T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Shane Koyczan"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/945758482163704/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Promo Gift Cards* with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Promotional Gift Card for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get $50 free in Promotional Gift Cards for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Holiday Combo Package \nFor only $75 get $50 in Gift Cards and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks. \n\nMSV Distinctive Recipes Cookbook\nOur MSV Distinctive Recipes cookbook lets you share in the experience of preparing uniquely styled entr\u00e9es and award-winning recipes.
