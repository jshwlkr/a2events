UMMA's trained docents will accompany small groups for a guided tour and provide the opportunity for everyone to experience different kinds of art and share their responses.\n\nMeet Me at UMMA is generously supported by the Monroe-Brown Foundation Discretionary Fund for Outreach to the State of Michigan and individual donors.\n\nTo register for this program, email kmpeil@alz.org, or call the local Alzheimer\u2019s Association 800.272.3900 at any time.

But she soon encountered the jarring realities of life in one of the poorest counties in America, still disabled by the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. In this stirring memoir, Kuo, the child of Taiwanese immigrants, shares the story of her complicated but rewarding mentorship of one student, Patrick Browning, and his remarkable literary and personal awakening.\n\nConvinced she can make a difference in the lives of her teenaged students, Michelle Kuo puts her heart into her work, using quiet reading time and guided writing to foster a sense of self in students left behind by a broken school system. Though Michelle loses some students to truancy and even gun violence, she is inspired by some such as Patrick. Fifteen and in the eighth grade, Patrick begins to thrive under Michelle\u2019s exacting attention. However, after two years of teaching, Michelle feels pressure from her parents and the draw of opportunities outside the Delta and leaves Arkansas to attend law school.\n\nThen, on the eve of her law-school graduation, Michelle learns that Patrick has been jailed for murder. Feeling that she left the Delta prematurely and determined to fix her mistake, Michelle returns to Helena and resumes Patrick\u2019s education\u2014even as he sits in a jail cell awaiting trial. Every day for the next seven months they pore over classic novels, poems, and works of history. Little by little, Patrick grows into a confident, expressive writer and a dedicated reader galvanized by the works of Frederick Douglass, James Baldwin, Walt Whitman, W. S. Merwin, and others. In her time reading with Patrick, Michelle is herself transformed, contending with the legacy of racism and the questions of what constitutes a \u201cgood\u201d life and what the privileged owe to those with bleaker prospects.\n\nReading with Patrick is an inspirational story of friendship, a coming-of-age story of both a young teacher and a student, a deeply resonant meditation on education, race, and justice in the rural South, and a love letter to literature and its power to transcend social barriers.\n\n\u201cThis book is special and could not be more right on time. It\u2019s an absorbing, tender, and surprisingly honest examination of race and privilege in America that helps articulate what is often lost, seemingly intentionally, in national debates over criminal justice and education: the inner life and imagination of a young person.\u201d\u2014Wes Moore, author of The Other Wes Moore \n\nMichelle Kuo taught English at an alternative school in the Arkansas Delta for two years. After teaching, she attended Harvard Law School as a Paul and Daisy Soros Fellow, and worked legal aid at a nonprofit for Spanish-speaking immigrants in the Fruitvale district of Oakland, California, on a Skadden Fellowship, with a focus on tenants\u2019 and workers\u2019 rights. She has volunteered as a teacher at the Prison University Project and clerked for a federal appeals court judge in the Ninth Circuit. Currently she teaches courses on race, law, and society at the American University in Paris."}, {"date": "2017-08-03T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1833531226961835/", "name": "Punk and Doom (II) at the Pig", "description": "Terrible as the Dawn -- chimeric experimental hardcore\nhttps://terribleasthedawn.bandcamp.com/releases\nhttps://www.facebook.com/terribleasthedawn/\n\nKing Under the Mountain -- fuzzy instrumental doom\nhttps://www.facebook.com/King-Under-the-Mountain-257361774605095/\n\nDaisys -- catchy, melodic punk rock\nhttps://www.facebook.com/daisystheband/\n\nNormal Park -- clean guitar emo/indie\nhttps://www.facebook.com/normalparkband/\n\ndoors at 9pm \n$7 ($10 under 21)"}, {"date": "2017-08-03T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/156257121611842/", "name": "TBT : 21+ get in Free", "description": "THROWBACK THURSDAY \nAll Your Favorite Music from the 80's, 90's & early 00's\n\nwith DJ Nick Donovan\n\n\u2022 FREE cover for 21 & over. $10 for 18-20.\n\n\u2022 MAGNIFICENT Drink Specials: $3.50 Well drinks, $2.50 Fireball shots, 3 for $10 Jaeger Bombs, $2 Miller Lite Bottles.\n\nMake sure to get your old school fix in before it's too late - this is LAST tbt of the summer!"}, {"date": "2017-08-04T10:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/431795093852172/", "name": "OUTFest & Pride Picnic 2017", "description": "Join us for OUTFest 2017 -- Ann Arbor's LGBTQ Pride Celebration. \n\nOUTFest, an annual pride celebration hosted by Jim Toy Community Center, returns to Ann Arbor's Kerrytown District with an array of activities for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) and allied communities.

She was the first to swim the frigid waters of the Bering Strait, the Strait of Magellan, and the coast of Antarctica, and she was the fastest to swim the English Channel. But it is a different kind of struggle that pushes her to the brink. In a short period of time, Lynne loses her father, and then her mother, and then Cody, her beloved Labrador retriever. Soon after, Lynne herself is diagnosed with a life-threatening heart condition that leaves her unable to swim and barely able to walk. \n\nBut against all odds, and with the support of her friends and family, Lynne begins the slow pull toward recovery, reaching always for the open waters that give her the freedom and mastery that mean everything to her. What follows is a beautifully poignant meditation on loss and an exhilarating celebration of life as, to Lynne\u2019s surprise, she begins to find, within the unfamiliar space of vulnerability, the greatest treasures\u2014like falling in love.\n\nLYNNE COX was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Los Alamitos, California. She has held open-water swimming records all over the world, swimming without a wetsuit. Cox has been inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

Everything they make, including their sauces, is cooked from scratch\u2014and passion. Now that\u2019s dedication to full flavor!\n\nJames R. Veteto and Ted Maclin, co-authors of The Slaw and the Slow Cooked: Culture and Barbecue in the Mid-south, say this about the Tennessee tradition: \u201cThe act of smoking barbecue has a certain Zen-like quality: minimalist, with an abiding awareness of temperature, smoke concentration, and the particulars of the meat. It is a meditation on time, smoke, and flesh that requires non-action as much as decisiveness.\u201d\n\nPat Martin opened the first Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint in October of 2006 in Nolensville, Tennessee, just south of Nashville. Today, there are four locations in the area, and they\u2019ve been featured on the Food Network, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel, and The Today Show and in publications such as Bon Appetit, Esquire, Conde Nast Traveler, and Men\u2019s Journal.\n\nWe welcome Pat to Zingerman\u2019s Roadhouse on Tuesday, August 8th, to enlighten us on how the tradition of slow-process bar-b-que can transform your palate. Don\u2019t miss out on experiencing a new regional barbecue technique and the discovery of transcending what we know about flavor!"}, {"date": "2017-08-08T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1978674785699472/", "name": "Ben Jansson Quartet", "description": "Ben Jansson, tenor saxophone\nRick Roe, piano\nPaul Keller, bass\nSean Dobbins, drums\n\n$30 Assigned Rows 1-2\n$20 Assigned Rows 3-5\n$15 General Admission\n$5 Student\n\nThis all-star group showcases compositions by Michigan native Jansson, who combines modern harmonic and rhythmic ideas within a traditional jazz quartet setting.

Her sister Louisa\u2014newly married and settled in rural Illinois\u2014anticipates tragedy, certain that Addie\u2019s fate is intertwined with her own legacy of loss.\n\nIn 1958, Louisa\u2019s daughter Hazel has her world upended by the untimely death of her husband. It\u2019s harvest time, and with two small children and a farm to tend, she is determined to keep her land and family intact. Yet even while she learns to enjoy her independence, Hazel realizes that the tradeoff for some freedoms is more precious than expected.\n\nNearly half a century later, Juanlan has returned to her parents\u2019 home in Heng\u2019an. With her father ill, her sister-in-law soon to give birth, and the construction of a new highway rapidly changing the town she once knew, she feels pressured on every side by powers outside her control. Frustrated by obligation and the smallness of her own dreams, Juanlan at last dares to follow desire, only to discover an anger that cannot be contained.\n\nMoving from rural Illinois to the far reaches of China, Rebellion brilliantly links through action and consequence the story of four women, spanning more than a century. From the secrets they keep and the adventures they embark on, to the passions that ultimately drive them forward, the characters at the center ofthis electric debut dramatically fight against expectation in pursuit of their own thrilling fates.\n\n\"Molly Patterson is a writer of the first order, and her debut novel is a revelatory, immersive miracle. Ambitious in scope and exacting in its language, Rebellion becomes a grand exploration of fate and circumstance.\"\u2014Claire Vaye Watkins, author of Gold Fame Citrus\n\nMolly Patterson was born in St. Louis and lived in China for several years. The winner of a 2014 Pushcart Prize, she was also the 2012-2013 writer-in-residence at St. Albans School in Washington, DC.

He found, however, that he could maneuver scissors through prepared sheets of brightly colored paper. He referred to this technique as \u201cpainting with scissors.\u201d Among his first adventures with paper cutouts was a book called Jazz, which Matisse prepared in 1942 and published in 1947. The book containing twenty color plates as well as his written thoughts was initially only printed in a hundred copies. Matisse viewed jazz as a \u201cchromatic and rhythmic improvisation.\u201d The title Jazz evoked for Matisse the idea of a structure of rhythm and repetition broken by the unexpected action of improvisations. He wrote, \u201cThere are wonderful things in real jazz, the talent for improvisation, the liveliness, the being at one with the audience.\u201d\n\nChristopher Bakriges, piano/composer\nGwen Laster, violin\n\nChristopher Bakriges\n\nBakriges is of Greek American decent, born in Detroit.

His teachers have included Oscar Peterson, Harold Danko, Nadi Qamar, Jimmy Giuffre, Dr. Billy Taylor, Tanjore Vishwanathan, Pandit Sushil Mukherjee, Frederick Simmons, and Alvin Lucier. His repertoire has forged a unique path that embodies the essence of jazz exploration, global influences and pure improvisation.\nBakriges is artist in residence at two Massachusetts schools, MassArt in Boston and Elms College in Chicopee. His most recent album, Clear and Present, is a quartet with Jay Hoggard, Avery Sharpe, and Billy Arnold.

When a natural disaster results in her mother\u2019s death and nearly takes the life of her younger brother Pip, Belle creates a fierce, almost ecstatic farewell song.  Thus begins her journey to compose a perfect Goodbye to Mama.\n\nAt 21, Belle ventures south to Ann Arbor for university, with teenaged Pip in tow. There, she befriends Robert Frost, Ted Roethke and Wystan Auden and finds that her poetry stands alongside theirs, and even with that of her hero, Dickinson. Her lyrics capture the sounds, sights, and rhythms of the changing seasons in the northern forests, amidst the rolling dunes by the shores of the Great Lake. \n\nDespite the peace she finds, Belle also struggles in both homes. Up north, she battles her father who thinks a woman can\u2019t run the family business; and clashes against developers who would scar the natural landscape. In Ann Arbor, she challenges the status quo of academic pedants and chauvinists.\n\nBelle\u2019s narrative brings these two places to life in their historic context: a growing Midwestern town driven by a public university, striving for greatness; and a rural peninsula seeking prosperity while preserving its natural heritage. Through the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, World War II, and the Post-War Boom, Belle\u2019s story is hard to put down. Her voice and songs will be even harder to forget.\n\nFor more than 70 years Paul Dimond has split most of his time between Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, and Glen Arbor, amidst Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Prior to researching and writing The Belle of Two Arbors, Paul Dimond served as the Director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights under Law, tried several major race cases that challenged a divided Supreme Court, became a Professor Law, and served as Special Assistant to President Clinton for Economic Policy. He has also practiced law, chaired a national real estate firm and continues to spend his time between his two Arbors. Currently, he works on behalf of several non-profits in Michigan so the heart of the Great Lakes can once again become a thriving home for fresh water and fresh ideas. He is the author of numerous articles and three books on policy, law and history, including Beyond Busing, recipient of the Ralph J. Bunche Book of the Year in 1986, as well as the author of three novels, including the youth title North Coast Almanac. He is an alumnus of Amherst College and the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nMartha (Marty) Buhr Grimes, a lifelong resident of Ann Arbor, also summered at her family cottage up north near Lake Michigan. She taught English, creative writing and poetry at secondary schools for 24 years, co-authored Summerskills language arts workbooks, and shared many hundreds of poems with her Paper Kite poetry group. Marty earned a BA in English and an MA in English and Education from the University of Michigan."}, {"date": "2017-08-15T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/230860050755857/", "name": "Poto MBA Video Challenge", "description": "Join the Poto MBA Video Challenge now through August 15th!\n\nHow do I participate in the Poto MBA Video Challenge?\n\n1.

So when he steps out of his Upper West Side brownstone on one exceptionally hot morning, he\u2019s not expecting to see the impossible: a woman from his life sixty years ago, cherry red lips, bright red hat, winking at him on a New York sidewalk, looking just as beautiful as she did back in 1934.\n\nThe sight causes him to suffer a stroke. And when he comes to, the renowned lyricist discovers he has lost the ability to communicate. Milo believes he must unravel his complicated history with Vivian Adair in order to win back his words. But he needs help\u2014in the form of his granddaughter Eleanor\u2014 failed journalist and family misfit. Tapped to write her grandfather\u2019s definitive biography, Eleanor must dig into Milo\u2019s colorful past to discover the real story behind Milo\u2019s greatest song Love Me, I Guess, and the mysterious woman who inspired an amazing life.\n\nA sweeping love story, family mystery and historical drama set eighty years apart, Vivian in Red will swell your heart like a favorite song while illuminating Broadway like you\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nKristina Riggle lives and writes in West Michigan. Her debut novel, Real Life & Liars, was a Target \u201cBreakout\u201d pick and a \u201cGreat Lakes, Great Reads\u201d selection by the Great Lakes Independent Booksellers Association. Her other novels have been honored by independent booksellers, including an IndieNext Notable designation for The Life You\u2019ve Imagined. Kristina has published short stories in the Cimarron Review, Literary Mama, Espresso Fiction, and elsewhere, and is a former co-editor for fiction at Literary Mama. Kristina was a full-time newspaper reporter before turning her attention to creative writing. She likes to run and read, though not at the same time.\n\n*\n\nAbout Jacquelyn's The Lake and the Lost Girl: On a stormy night in 1939, Mary Stone Walker disappears from her home in White Hill, Michigan. Everyone knew the talented poet was desperate to escape her demons, but when Mary goes missing without a trace, one question lingers in the small town: Did Mary successfully break free of her troubled past and flee, or did her life end that night?\n\nSixty years later, Lydia Carroll's husband is still fixated on the local mystery. English Professor Frank Carroll has invested years in the search for local poet Mary Stone Walker and her lost works, sacrificing his family, his reputation, and even Lydia for the ever-more unlikely discovery. As Frank's behavior grows more erratic, Lydia sees that his interest in Mary has evolved into an obsession-one that threatens to destroy the family they have built together, and which can only be undone by solving the mystery of what happened to Mary on that rainy night in 1939.\n\nThe Lake and the Lost Girl tells the riveting story of secrets from the past unraveling one family from the inside out, and two women, separated by sixty years of history, determined to pursue their dreams.\n\nJacquelyn Vincenta spent her childhood in the suburbs of Washington, DC where she discovered the alchemy of language and imagination at a young age. After graduating from the University of Iowa with a B.A. in English Literature she started her writing life as a police beat reporter for a daily newspaper near New Orleans. While raising a family in Texas and Michigan she worked as managing editor of the publishing company she and her then-husband owned, wrote magazine articles, and became involved with non-profit organizations dedicated to the arts and environmental issues. Jacquelyn works part-time for a translation company based in Prague, and devotes herself to her writing.

Margot Finn", "description": "Literati is delighted to celebrate the publication of Discriminating Taste: How Class Anxiety Created the American Food Revolution by S. Margot Finn.\n\nFor the past four decades, increasing numbers of Americans have started paying greater attention to the food they eat, buying organic vegetables, drinking fine wines, and seeking out exotic cuisines. Yet they are often equally passionate about the items they refuse to eat: processed foods, generic brands, high-carb meals. While they may care deeply about issues like nutrition and sustainable agriculture, these discriminating diners also seek to differentiate themselves from the unrefined eater, the common person who lives on junk food.\n\nDiscriminating Taste argues that the rise of gourmet, ethnic, diet, and organic foods must be understood in tandem with the ever-widening income inequality gap. Offering an illuminating historical perspective on our current food trends, S. Margot Finn draws numerous parallels with the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century, an era infamous for its class divisions, when gourmet dinners, international cuisines, slimming diets, and pure foods first became fads.\n\nExamining a diverse set of cultural touchstones ranging from Ratatouille to The Biggest Loser, Finn identifies the key ways that \u201cgood food\u201d has become conflated with high status. She also considers how these taste hierarchies serve as a distraction, leading middle-class professionals to focus on small acts of glamorous and virtuous consumption while ignoring their class\u2019s larger economic stagnation. A provocative look at the ideology of contemporary food culture, Discriminating Taste teaches us to question the maxim that you are what you eat.\n\n\"Finn's compelling argument about the role of class in today's food culture is sure to have a major impact on how both scholars and foodies think about the food revolution.\"--Charlotte Biltekoff, author of Eating Right in America: The Cultural Politics of Food and Health\n\n\"Finn offers an engaging and compelling explanation for the rise of the modern food movement. It's one that the leaders of the movement will no doubt find unsettling.\"--Jayson Lusk, author of Unnaturally Delicious and The Food Police\n\nS. Margot Finn is a lecturer in literature, science, and the arts at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor."}, {"date": "2017-08-19T09:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1816943561954084/", "name": "Stewardship Workday", "description": "The 3 miles of trails in Bird Hills give some lovely views of the Huron River.

He writes songs that blend the roots of American music with gritty rock n\u2019 roll and vintage soul. Performing Songwriter Magazine called the result, \"Some of the liveliest and most rocking roots music around. \nFor over 15 years Joshua has made his living sharing his songs, stories and knowledge across the US and Canada at festivals, concert halls, coffeehouses and dives \u2013 as a solo act, front man for roots ensemble \"Steppin\u2019 In It\", classic swing band \"Shout Sister Shout\", songwriter showcase band \"The Starlight Six\" and frequently as a workshop facilitator, presenter or instructor. \nHis music is steeped in ragtime blues, sweet jazz and real country but Davis\u2019s broad schooling in the cultural, political and musical roots of American tradition has resulted in more than a simple retelling of universal themes. Dubbed, \"the Michigan version of the Great American Songscape\" (Chris Reitz, Elderly Instruments), his catalog is a seamless snapshot of American past and present. Joshua has shared stages with a diverse list of luminaries, such as Tim O\u2019Brien, Greg Brown, The Indigo Girls, Leftover Salmon, The Dixie Hummingbirds, Corey Harris, John Gorka, Jeff Daniels, Ellis Paul, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Jimmy LaFave, Ray Bonneville, Arlo Guthrie, Abigail Washburn, Larry McCray, Sunny Wilkinson, Catie Curtis, Bill Kirchen, Peter \"Madcat\" Ruth, Bernie Leadon, Wayne Hancock, The Verve Pipe, John Hammond, Pete Seeger and Preservation Hall Jazz Band.  Davis has released three critically acclaimed solo albums, five albums with Steppin\u2019 In It, a record of jazz standards with Shout Sister Shout, and has appeared on too many albums to count. His most recent album, \"A Miracle of Birds\" is inspired by his travels in the Palestinian West Bank with non-profit organization On the Ground. About the album, Revue magazine says, \"His heartfelt documentation of 'people as people' offers up compassionate songs of hope, darkness and perseverance.\" \n\nJoshua has performed live on the internationally syndicated programs Mountain Stage, Woodsongs Old-Time Radio Hour and Backstage Pass. His songs have been featured on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered, Folk Alley and The Mix and he has played scores of prestigious festivals and venues not to mention every festival Michigan has to offer."}, {"date": "2017-08-24T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/154052318488192/", "name": "Sherry Stanfa-Stanley: Finding My Badass Self", "description": "Literati is pleased to welcome Sherry Stanfa-Stanley in support of her memoir, Finding My Badass Self: A Year of Truths and Dares.\n\nFighting midlife inertia, Sherry Stanfa-Stanley chose to stare down fear through The 52/52 Project: a year of weekly new experiences designed to push her far outside her comfort zone.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, the Rainbow Seekers could illuminate the very chambers of Heaven. Lead singer Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.\n\nThe Rainbow Seekers began their quest beneath the fingertips of songwriter Joe Hertler. Bassist and producer Kevin Pritchard, recently thawed from an extremely rare prehistoric groove glacier, discovered the forlorn Hertler in a twinkling, mysteriously fortuitous place called The Quilted Attic. Alongside legendary glacier-hunter Rick Hale\u2014who would later spend decades forging a drumset from pure, white-hot, ancient stardust to mark the occasion\u2014Pritchard changed the world: He wrangled Hertler into musical collaboration. And the lonely little songsmith, it turned out, was not quite as alone as he seemed: With him came the irresistibly sexy blues guitar prodigy who is now known to the world as Ryan Hoger.\n\nThe core of the Rainbow was thereby established, and it didn\u2019t take long for the Rainbow Seekers to continue their expansion. Multi-instrumentalist and notable auxiliary percussion maestro Micah Bracken journeyed from the bowels of Atlantis when he heard tell of the Rainbow, and the earth trembled as saxophonist and all-around bad ass Aaron Stinson descended from Olympus on a golden rainbow of his own. Then came Stinson's little-known winged companion from the Far East, the debonair violist Joshua Barber Holcomb\u2014When he saw the pure, unadulterated joy the Rainbow Seekers sprinkled on every crowd they happened upon, he had no choice but to join them on their quest. As you'll know if you've seen the band, seeking the proverbial Rainbow is all about the live performance. \"The live show is the purpose of the band. This is why we make music. Playing music is a symbiotic process, and without a crowd it is just a bunch of guys jamming,\" says Hertler. \"We believe that performance is not a High Art operation, and that you should do anything you can to ensure that the crowd is having a good time. From pi\u00f1atas to confetti, to fog, to flowers, to drum solos, to strobe lights, to Thor, to sword battles\u2014literally anything goes.\"  If you're still reading this, at least one thing is true: The Rainbow Seekers have been waiting for you. If you'll only let them, they will shake the dust from your wildest expectations. They will roar into your life with rapturous frequencies, exuberant tone, and a joyfulness of purpose that has truly become a rare sight on stage. Join them in their celebration, and they will take you on a never-ending journey to a place you'll never be able to describe in words."}, {"date": "2017-08-31T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/118227762130905/", "name": "Ghastly at Necto", "description": "React Detroit presents...\n\n:: Ghastly ::\nWelcome Week Bash\n\nSupport by:\nMielo\n\nNecto Nightclub\n516 E.

Born in Trim, Co. Meath, to John Keenan, Sr. of Westmeath and the former Mary Bravender of Co. Cavan. The Keenans were a Travelling family steeped in traditional music; both Paddy's father and grandfather were uilleann pipers. Paddy himself took up the pipes at the age of ten, playing his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, when he was 14. He later played with the rest of his family in a group called The Pavees. At 17, having fallen in love with the blues, Paddy left Ireland for England and Europe, where he played blues and rock. Returning to Ireland after a few years, he began playing around Dublin with singer/keyboardist Triona Ni Dhomhnaill and singer/guitarist Micheal O Dhomhnaill. Fiddler Paddy Glackin joined the three, then flute player Matt Molloy, accordionist Tony MacMahon, and guitarist Donal Lunny. Thus was born one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, The Bothy Band. Paddy was one of the band's founding members, and his virtuosity on the pipes combined with the ferocity of his playing made him, in the opinion of many, its driving force. Bothy Band-mate Donal Lunny once described Paddy as \"the Jimi Hendrix of the pipes\".\n\nSince the breakup of The Bothy Band in 1979, Paddy has toured as a soloist, bringing the finest example of traditional Irish music and uilleann piping to audiences around the globe, performing in Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Australia, across Europe, Russia, and of course America.\n\nVisit Paddy on the web here: http://www.paddykeenan.com/"}, {"date": "2017-09-06T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1453175954726093/", "name": "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong with Flamingosis at Blind Pig", "description": "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong\n\nwith Special Guest Flamingosis\n\nWed. 09.06.15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor, MI\n\n$14 Adv.// $16 Day of \n\n18+\n\nDoors 9pm / Show 10pm\n\n \u201cSomethin For Ya\u201d Pro-Shot Live Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIGTyR-iD-w\n\nPigeons Playing Ping Pong brings end-of-the-world enthusiasm to their high-energy psychedelic funk.

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that.

That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.
