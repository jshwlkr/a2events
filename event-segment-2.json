I have never met Jordan Zandi, but I would like to, for there is a sweet spirit haunting his guileless poems. His inner world is always interacting with the outer world, and as a result everything seems to be shining. 'Walking across the binary field, / what does the young man see?' Zandi asks, searching for signs with his subtle eyes. The answer seems to be the great opium of simply being content within oneself\u2014with a heart that receives and watches (if a heart watches), while resisting the systems that hurt us\u2014and remaining awake to experience.\"\u2014Henri Cole, from the Foreword  \n\nJordan Zandi is the author of Solarium (Sarabande Books), which was chosen by Henri Cole as the winner of the Kathryn A. Morton Prize.

Ryan Packard is known mostly for his extensive work as a composer and percussionist within the thriving contemporary classical scene in Chicago, while Albert Wildeman has achieved fame for his meteoric rise from novice instrumentalist to one of the busiest players in town after relocating to Chicago from the Netherlands in 2011 to immerse himself in the city\u2019s broad-shouldered music world. These two contribute noticeably fresh perspectives to this ongoing and ever-evolving local dialogue, a world of which Rempis has been a flagship member for almost two decades. As a trio, their voice carries a unique shape, combining a love for full-on blasts of energy with a sensitivity to the smallest details, resulting in music that can be a freight train one moment, and an insectoid microcosm the next. The band released their first recording, Polynya, on Aerophonic Records in the summer of 2016, and is on tour throughout North America this fall.\n\nThis performance is made possible through the generous sponsorship of The Maxine and Stuart Frankel Foundation in honor of Maurice and Linda Binkow on the occasion of her 80th birthday and their 60th wedding anniversary.

Showcased are some important twentieth-century Austrian and German expressionist artists, including Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Ernst Kirchner, and Oskar Kokoschka, who paved the way for future generations of the avant-garde, and the Italian Giovanni Battista Piranesi, one of the most inventive draftsmen and printmakers of the eighteenth century. The works in this multi- faceted collection capture artistic compulsions and creative responses to the physical and spiritual world, from tangled, emotionally embroiled nudes to meticulous landscapes and architectural vistas. This exemplary gift from late U-M professor emeritus Ernst Pulgram and his wife, associate professor emerita and chief editor of the Middle English Compendium, Frances McSparran, offers a glimpse into the rich history of European graphic art.\n\n\rLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Richard and Rosann Noel Endowment Fund.

They play original and traditional music in a variety of forms \u2013 original musical settings of a broad array of poetry, original instrumental pieces, and traditional Irish tunes and songs. This unique collaboration brings out qualities in both of these seasoned musicians that you may not have heard from them before.  Their music is rendered with lush beauty, sensitivity and humor on an unusual array of strings  -- various guitars in varied tunings, mandola, mandolin, bouzouki, cittern, tenor guitar -- and their blended voices.\n\n They take the name Noctambule, French for 'night-owl,\u2019 from a Robert Service poem about a nocturnal ramble through the back alleys of Paris, which they have set to music and included on their acclaimed CD Travel in the Shadows.  Their first CD together, it explores many forms of the \u2018night journey\u2019 in song, offering the traveler the opportunity to see and experience things differently once the usual sources of light have been extinguished.  They have selected a broad variety of \u2018noctambulatory\u2019 verse from Tennyson, Neruda, Roethke, St. Vincent Millay, and Robert Service. In addition, they include two original instrumental pieces \u2013 a reel and a waltz \u2013 as well as one traditional Irish song. \n\n BRUCE VICTOR is an eclectic and accomplished guitarist and composer, who plays several different guitars in several different tunings. Seemingly resisting any single musical genre, he has been labeled a 'poly-stylist\u2019 by one of the editors of Acoustic Guitar magazine. He has played with The Sirens of San Francisco, The Triplicates, and as a solo performer.  He was the founder of The Acoustic Vortex, a non-profit musical organization that produced house concerts, mentored youth performers, and performed benefit concerts for other non-profit organizations.  He is also a practicing psychiatrist and was a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n MARLA FIBISH is well known in the Irish music world, bringing a musicality and excitement to the tradition that is seldom heard on the mandolin.  She is also known for her compositions, musical settings of poetry and instrumental pieces that have been featured in her work with Out of the Rain, and Three Mile Stone, and on her acclaimed instrumental recording with Jimmy Crowley, The Morning Star. In addition to the mandolin, Marla brings mandola, tenor guitar, bouzouki, accordion, and her alto voice to the Noctambule sound.\n\nPack something warm, and come prepared for adventure ....\n\nVisit Noctambule on the web at http://www.noctambulemusic.com/", "name": "Noctambule - In Concert", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1357192890965241/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-16T18:00:00-04:00", "description": "Our annual awards event, the Civvies, is coming up!

Brit will be joined in conversation by Chris McCormick, the author of Desert Boys.\n\nSet within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett\u2019s mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret. \u201cAll good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we\u2019d taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.\u201d\n\nIt is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother\u2019s recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor\u2019s son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it\u2019s not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance\u2014and the subsequent cover-up\u2014will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt.\n\nIn entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a \u201cwhat if\u201d can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.\n\n\u201cBrit Bennett\u2019s masterful debut is brimming with unforgettable scenes and the sort of keenly-observed, precise language that makes you look at your own relationships anew. Told with the wisdom of a seasoned, compassionate storyteller, The Mothers is a novel about community, friendship, grief and growth. The two women at the center of this novel are characters you will find yourself thinking about long after you\u2019ve turned the last page\u2013 they pull you in close and never let you go. Bennett is a brilliant and much-needed new voice in literature.\u201d \u2013Angela Flournoy, author of National Book Award-finalist The Turner House\n\n\u201cBrit Bennett\u2019s The Mothers is an engaging and assured debut novel of depth, and introspective power. It succeeds as a brilliant study of a modern black woman, and as a lyrical and majestic portrait of her place in society.\u201d \u2014Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen\n\n\u201cWonderful \u2013 warm and tender and necessary.\u201d \u2013Yaa Gyasi, author of Homegoing \n\nBorn and raised in Southern California, Brit Bennett graduated from Stanford University and later earned her MFA in fiction at the University of Michigan, where she won a Hopwood Award in Graduate Short Fiction as well as the 2014 Hurston/Wright Award for College Writers.

Bassist and producer Kevin Pritchard, recently thawed from an extremely rare prehistoric groove glacier, discovered the forlorn Hertler in a twinkling, mysteriously fortuitous place called The Quilted Attic. Alongside legendary glacier-hunter Rick Hale-who would later spend decades forging a drum set from pure, white-hot, ancient stardust to mark the occasion-Pritchard changed the world: He wrangled Hertler into musical collaboration.

Ms. Butter has spent nearly 30 years inspiring countless children to find the courage to take compassionate action and transcend obstacles. The film depicts Ms. Butter\u2019s poignant connection to Anne Frank, her own childhood experiences in two concentration camps, and her choice to adopt an empowered view of her history, leading to a life of openheartedness, joy, and activism.\rThe screening will be followed by a talk back with film director, Evelyn Neuhaus, and Irene Butter.\r\n\nIrene Butter was born in Berlin, Germany and grew up Jewish in Nazi-occupied Europe. A survivor of two concentration camps, she came to the U.S. in 1945. After graduating from Queens College in New York, she earned a PhD in economics from Duke University and taught at the University of Michigan for over 35 years. Since 1987, she has been visiting schools to teach students about the Holocaust and the lessons she learned during those traumatic years. She co-founded the Wallenberg lecture series honoring global change- makers and the Arab-Jewish women\u2019s dialog group, Zeitouna. Butter resides with her husband in Ann Arbor.\n\n\rEvelyn Neuhaus is a first-time filmmaker. She knew Irene Butter, the subject of Never a Bystander, for decades before learning that Butter was a Holocaust survivor and hearing her story. In 2007, Neuhaus was an assistant producer for Refusing to Be Enemies: The Zeitouna Story, about an Arab-Jewish women\u2019s dialogue group Butter co-founded. She holds an MPH and an MBA from the University of Michigan and resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

October 27 | 8pm | All Ages | $25 Cover\n\nann arbor's 107one Presents:\nBrett Dennen wsg: Lily & Madeleine\n\nAs common and simple as it is, \"por favor\" is such an evocative expression. From Spanish, it translates to \"please,\" a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. \"Por favor' was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,\" says Brett Dennen. \"We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.\"\n\n\"When you say please, you're asking something to come into your life,\" Dennen adds. \"It might mean that you're weak and need something to make you strong. But you're admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.\"\n\nThat notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen's intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.\n\n\"All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn't feeling confident about myself,\" he says. \"When I'm not feeling confident, I'm not a nice person to be around. I don't take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I'm in that place.\"\n\nA followup to 2013's Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It's the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it's by no means a sad affair, nor is it the \"rainyday record\" Dennen initially thought he was making.\n\nOften framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. \"And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let's go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,\" he sings over a chugging groove on \"Bonfire.\"\n\nOn \"Where We Left Off,\" the album's emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: \"Everyone knows I'm a happy man/ But I haven't been right.\"\n\n\"Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,\" Dennen admits. \"Is there something I'm scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren't in that zone.\"\n\n\"I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,\" he continues. \"I don't have to worry about whether they'll be on the radio or if they're different from my previous stuff.\"\n\nHoled up at Cobb's Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb's insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. \"We recorded it the way people made records in the '60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,\" he says. \"We didn't do anything more than five times. We didn't secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It's not sloppy, but it's in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.\"\n\nCobb adds, \"I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He's very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.\"\n\nMore than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. \"My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,\" he says.\n\nThat marked a detour from his most recent releases. With those he felt like he was exercising his craftsmanship - \"being a songwriter for the sake of being a songwriter,\" as he puts it. \"I really wanted this new album to come across as a whole piece,\" Dennen says. \"I consider it to be a batch of songs that all live together and complement each other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the album title. Please.\n\n\"What was I asking for with this album\" Dennen says. \"I wanted to be a good person and feel good about myself again, but in a way that I knew it was OK to be sad. That's part of life, the ups and downs. But with these songs, I want to make people feel good about themselves and about life through the good and bad.\"\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/718", "name": "Brett Dennen w/ Lily and Madeleine 10/27/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1735261526750729/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-27T21:00:00-04:00", "description": "Come One...

November 10 | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nTucker Beathard  wsg: Aubrie Sellers\n\nTucker Beathard - Growing up in a family that excelled at both music and sports \u2014 his father is a hit songwriter; his brothers, star quarterbacks \u2014 Big Machine Label Group recording artist Tucker Beathard has an unrelenting competitive spirit: He wakes up every day trying to write the perfect song. For Tucker, a self-taught guitarist and drummer, there's no such thing as \"good enough.\"   \"I love anything with great melodies and I'm drawn to the little things,\" Tucker says, rattling off his influences with an artist's attention to detail. \"When I listen to Led Zeppelin, I focus on John Bonham's drums. Or Joe Walsh's guitar licks in the Eagles. And Hank Williams Jr.'s 'Family Tradition' is as country songwriting as it gets.\"  Tucker certainly knows something about family tradition, taking cues from dad Casey Beathard, who wrote Kenny Chesney's \"Don't Blink\" and Eric Church's \"Homeboy.\" The latter, in fact, was inspired by Tucker, who admits to going through his own rebellious phase.  Giving up a college baseball scholarship to dive headlong into songwriting, Tucker came out better for his diverse experiences and documented those wild times in the wise-beyond-its-years \"Momma and Jesus.\" The track is one of many in contention for his debut album, being overseen by producer Angelo Petraglia (Kings Of Leon).   With a rhythmic way of playing guitar, influenced by his innate drumming ability, Tucker has created some of contemporary country music's most progressive songs. \"Rock On,\" a song about regretting the girl that got away, is taut in its delivery, with clever turns of phrase. Likewise, \"20-10 Tennessee,\" a standout, uses a football game as metaphor for a relationship and \u201cBetter Than Me\u201d puts a unique spin on an arena-ready breakup anthem, ultimately wishing the best for someone after parting ways.   \"I've always been a huge fan of deep songs, and I've always liked poems,\" he says. \"I'm an introvert, but writing songs that go beneath the surface allows me the chance to open up a piece of myself.\"   As does his engaging live show.  Having played with artists like Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert, Tucker regularly bares his soul in front of a crowd. Despite his reserved demeanor, the stage is where he is most free \u2014 it's his canvas to paint an honest picture of who he is, as both a songwriter and an artist.   \"Expressing yourself onstage and putting your emotion into each song is a feeling that is tough to match. It's your way of letting the world know who you are,\" says Tucker, who has one main goal when performing. \"Whether it's 'My heart is broken' or 'Let's party tonight,' I want people to feel this is a real dude who knows who he is \u2014 and who says it like it is.\"", "name": "Tucker Beathard 11/10/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/309962236060767/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-11T08:00:00-05:00", "description": "Books and brews are a-go!

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\n\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\n\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\n\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal. It\u2019s a transformation record.\u201d We are so pleased to welcome Mary Gauthier into our Series. www.marygauthier.com", "name": "Mary Gauthier at Green Wood Coffee House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/676020209212879/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-12T23:00:00-05:00", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Promo Gift Cards* with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Promotional Gift Card for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get $50 free in Promotional Gift Cards for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Holiday Combo Package \nFor only $75 get $50 in Gift Cards and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks. \n\nMSV Distinctive Recipes Cookbook\nOur MSV Distinctive Recipes cookbook lets you share in the experience of preparing uniquely styled entr\u00e9es and award-winning recipes.

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/619658961515550/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "description": "Grammy Award winner Don Henry's songs have been recorded by legends such as Ray Charles, Patti Page and Conway Twitty; by country crooners including Gene Watson, John Conlee and B.J.

This will be a no-drop group ride and is a great chance for novice MTBer's to get exposure to single track riding and be a fun way to burn off that Thanksgiving feast and get a jump start on getting fit for 2017.  The ride will be about 14 miles long covering ~5.5 miles at Hewens Creek and ~6.5 miles at Rolling Hills along with a few miles of dirt road connecting the two parks.  For those who haven't ridden or rarely ride at either trail, Hewens Creek is a flat, winding ride through meadows and new growth forest which is great for beginning riders.  The RHP trail on the other hand twists and turns through 4+ miles of forest and rolling hills that provide a great opportunity to improve your bike handling skills and 2.5+ miles of open meadows.  The 1.2-mile West Meadows loop on the west side of RHP includes beautiful open meadows and some fun pump-track like riding on the Munger Mounds.   \n\nMeet at the Rolling Hills Lodge at 9:45 AM and then we will head out by 10-10:15 AM.  After the ride, we will have some pizza and refreshments at the lodge at about 12:30 PM.  Please register in advance at Event Brite to attend so a good estimate of riders can be made for the pizza and beverages.  Rain date will be Saturday 11/26 at 10 AM.

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound. With support from the likes of Diplo, Omarion, and JoJo, plus tours with artists like Chance the Rapper, Flume and Chet Faker, the producer has clearly caught the eye some of a wide variety of tastemakers. Featured by the likes of Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Boiler Room and The FADER, Cuna has also received admiration from music journalists the world over, drawing almost universal praise from disparate outlets. With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory. And that\u2019s part of the reason why Cuna connects with his fan base on such a visceral level, eschewing traditional industry methods for his own unique, intimate manner of going about business.\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/768", "name": "Sweater Beats12/2/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1759418600997980/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-03T09:00:00-05:00", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Gift Certificates with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get a free $50 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Combo Package \nFor only $75 get a $50 Gift Card and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks \n\nOur Gift Cards and MSV Combo Package can be purchased at our restaurant,\n by calling (888) 456-3463 (DINE), or visit us online at: www.mainstreetventuresinc.com/shop. \n\nTake advantage of this special offer.

In Toronto, on his first out of town gig, he met Canadian songwriter Joni Anderson. They married, and as a duo Chuck and Joni Mitchell played the coffeehouse circuit, and gin rummy, until they divorced in 1968. Mitchell's credits include A Prairie Home Companion and repertory theatre in Texas and in England. He has played Harold Hill in The Music Man and Woody Guthrie in Woody Guthrie's American Song. Most recently, he wrote and produced Mr. Foster & Mr. Twain, in which Stephen Foster joins Mark Twain for an evening of story and song. A Chuck Mitchell's show combines his seasoned skills as an actor, singer and guitarist with a selection of delightful material. He sings cabaret songs by Brecht and Weil -- \"Mack the Knife\" and \"The Bilbao Song\" -- and whimsical songs by Flanders & Swann -- \"The Gnu\" and \"Have Some Madeira, M'dear\". He roves the room singing \"Freeborn Man\" by Ewan McColl, or \"Necessity\" from Finian's Rainbow. He weaves poetry by Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot into his shows. He has been called a renaissance man, and thinks he is old enough to be one.\nwww.mitchellsong.com", "name": "Chuck Mitchell at Green Wood Coffee House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/277240782615400/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-10T16:00:00-05:00", "description": "Save these dates to head over to beautiful Buhr Park (unless noted otherwise) and see fast paced, full contact roller derby action from your local league, Ann Arbor Derby Dimes!\n\nMay 14 - June 11 - July 9 - August 6\n\nBUY 2016 SEASON PASSES: http://bpt.me/2537986\n\nJuly 9\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Border City Brawlers: All-Stars\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Border City Brawlers: Canadian Clubbers\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/29dSJv0\nBUY JULY 9 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539693\n\nAugust 6\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Flint City Derby Girls\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Killamazoo Derby Darlins: Kill Squad\nBUY AUGUST 6 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539697\n\nFor more information, see our 2016 season schedule: http://a2derbydimes.org/2016-schedule\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\nPreviously this season:\n\nMay 14\nBrawlstars vs The Chicago Outfit: Syndicate\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs East Lansing Roller Derby: Broadbarians\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/1reSK5y\nBUY MAY 14 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2537998\n\nJune 11\nBrawlstars vs North Star Roller Girls: Supernovas\nArbor Bruising Co. vs North Star Roller Girls: Northern Lights\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/29dSikp\nBUY JUNE 11 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2538000", "name": "Ann Arbor Derby Dimes 2016 season", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/192972824428594/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-10T23:00:00-05:00", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Promo Gift Cards* with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Promotional Gift Card for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get $50 free in Promotional Gift Cards for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Holiday Combo Package \nFor only $75 get $50 in Gift Cards and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks. \n\nMSV Distinctive Recipes Cookbook\nOur MSV Distinctive Recipes cookbook lets you share in the experience of preparing uniquely styled entr\u00e9es and award-winning recipes.

While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "name": "Dopapod & Pigeons Playing Ping Pong at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1574155032886638/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-16T20:00:00-05:00", "description": "Katie Geddes sings traditional and contemporary folk, country-folk, and folk-pop tunes.
