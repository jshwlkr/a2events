Each of its three sessions investigate critical social changes produced by war: in Ann Arbor, the far-reaching effects of the G.I. Bill in expanding higher education to an entire generation of men; in Willow Run the profound influence of female and African American employment in defense industries alongside a personal testament evoked by the mammoth, now empty buildings; in Detroit the ripples of musical exchange that ran alongside racial, religious, and ethnic conflict. The three sessions draw upon a lively mix of scholars, artists, and musicians, who, in turn, explore the unprecedented mixing that characterized wartime America.\nSymposium schedule:\n\n2 \u20134 p.m. Ann Arbor: \"The GI Bill and Its Impact on Higher Education,\" featuring lectures by Glenn Altschuler and Philo Hutcheson.\n\n4 \u20134:15 p.m. Visit UMMA exhibition Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory\n\n\n4:15\u20136:30 p.m. \"Willow Run: Gender, Race, and Factory Work During and After World War II,\" featuring Ernestine Ruben, her collaborator composer Stephen Hartke, UMMA Assistant Curator of Photography Jennifer Friess, Ruth Milkman, and Katie Rosenblatt.\n\n6:30\u20137:30 p.m. Break.

For years, he and his wife, Gillian, have lived beyond their means. Now their debts and bad decisions are catching up with them, and Kyung is anxious for his family\u2019s future. A few miles away, his parents, Jin and Mae, live in the town\u2019s most exclusive neighborhood, surrounded by the material comforts that Kyung desires for his wife and son. Growing up, they gave him every possible advantage\u2014private tutors, expensive hobbies\u2014but they never showed him kindness. Kyung can hardly bear to see them now, much less ask for their help. Yet when an act of violence leaves Jin and Mae unable to live on their own, the dynamic suddenly changes, and he\u2019s compelled to take them in. For the first time in years, the Chos find themselves living under the same roof. Tensions quickly mount as Kyung\u2019s proximity to his parents forces old feelings of guilt and anger to the surface, along with a terrible and persistent question: how can he ever be a good husband, father, and son when he never knew affection as a child?\n\nAs Shelter veers swiftly toward its startling conclusion, Jung Yun leads us through dark and violent territory, where, unexpectedly, the Chos discover hope. Shelter is a masterfully crafted debut novel that asks what it means to provide for one's family and, in answer, delivers a story as riveting as it is profound.\n\n\"Shelter is domestic drama at its best, a gripping narrative of secrets and revelations that seized me from beginning to end.\"\u2014Viet Thanh Nguyen, Pulitzer Prize-Winning author of The Sympathizer\n\nJung Yun was born in South Korea, grew up in North Dakota, and educated at Vassar College, the University of Pennsylvania, and University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Dan will be joined for a post-reading conversation by UM MFA first year in fiction Sam Krowchenko.\n\nTwo sensational unsolved crimes\u2014one in the past, another in the present\u2014are linked by one man\u2019s memory and self-deception in this chilling novel of literary suspense from National Book Award finalist Dan Chaon. \u201cWe are always telling a story to ourselves, about ourselves.\u201d This is one of the little mantras Dustin Tillman likes to share with his patients, and it\u2019s meant to be reassuring. But what if that story is a lie? A psychologist in suburban Cleveland, Dustin is drifting through his forties when he hears the news: His adopted brother, Rusty, is being released from prison. Thirty years ago, Rusty received a life sentence for the massacre of Dustin\u2019s parents, aunt, and uncle. The trial came to epitomize the 1980s hysteria over Satanic cults; despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury believed the outlandish accusations Dustin and his cousin made against Rusty. Now, after DNA analysis has overturned the conviction, Dustin braces for a reckoning.\n\nMeanwhile, one of Dustin\u2019s patients has been plying him with stories of the drowning deaths of a string of drunk college boys. At first Dustin dismisses his patient\u2019s suggestions that a serial killer is at work as paranoid thinking, but as the two embark on an amateur investigation, Dustin starts to believe that there\u2019s more to the deaths than coincidence. Soon he becomes obsessed, crossing all professional boundaries\u2014and putting his own family in harm\u2019s way. From one of today\u2019s most renowned practitioners of literary suspense, Ill Will is an intimate thriller about the failures of memory and the perils of self-deception. In Dan Chaon\u2019s nimble, chilling prose, the past looms over the present, turning each into a haunted place.\n\n\u201cDan Chaon\u2019s new novel is subtly, steadily unnerving\u2014like a scalpel slipping under your skin and prying it, ever so slowly, from the muscle beneath. Ill Will is a dark M\u00f6bius strip of a thriller that will leave you questioning what\u2019s perceived and what\u2019s imagined, and whether the reverberations of tragedy ever truly come to an end.\u201d\u2014Celeste Ng, author of Everything I Never Told You\n\nDan Chaon is the acclaimed author of Among the Missing, which was a finalist for the National Book Award, and You Remind Me of Me, which was named one of the best books of the year by The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, The Christian Science Monitor, and Entertainment Weekly, among other publications. Chaon\u2019s fiction has appeared in many journals and anthologies, including The Best American Short Stories, Pushcart Prize, and The O. Henry Prize Stories. He has been a finalist for the National Magazine Award in Fiction, and he was the recipient of the 2006 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Chaon lives in Cleveland, Ohio, and teaches at Oberlin College, where he is the Pauline M. Delaney Professor of Creative Writing.\n \n\nEvent date: \nThursday, March 16, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment.\n\nWritten for a general audience by a surveillance law expert, this book educates readers about how the reality of modern surveillance differs from popular understanding. Weaving the history of American surveillance - from J. Edgar Hoover through the tragedy of September 11th to the fusion centers and mosque infiltrators of today - the book shows that mass surveillance and democracy are fundamentally incompatible. Granick shows how surveillance law has fallen behind while surveillance technology has given American spies vast new powers.

March 17 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nElectric 6\nwsg: Residual Kid & PALACES\n\nEternal life can seem like an eternity. Ask any vampire. The continuous march of sun ups, sun downs, transformations of form, seductions, cape fittings & exsanguinations. Eventually it all just becomes an endless, tired routine. It all seems so exciting & so sexy to those of us who operate knowing we have limited time. But ask any vampire about the downside of eternal life, & you won't be surprised to hear tales of binge eating garlic bread just to feel the hurt, or of the occasional dangling of a wooden stake just over the center of the rib cage. Electric Six knows all about eternal life. Electric Six has been around forever & it can never die. That's lovely, but it's also very tiring. Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres is the new release by Electric Six on Metropolis Records. One listen & you will immediately understand that the sexiest vampires are urban vampires. Where E6 has dabbled in dance, hip-hop & R&B in the past, Fresh Blood is the whole enchilada. It's thirteen songs designed to make the listener interested in smooth & nasty fuckin', the way they do it in the city. From the Grandmaster Flash-inspired Number Of The Beast to the super smooth tour of the NYC outer boroughs Mood Is Improving, the listener finds himself immediately deposited into an urban drop zone with hustlas & dickblockas coming from behind every corner. The radio-ready pop hits I'll Be In Touch & Dance With Dark Forces are the tracks that get the listener off the street & into the club. & it would not be an Electric Six album without an epic closer, that being the beautiful & haunting Spacewalkin', the ballad that assures the listener that the vampire has now fed & will live a thousand more years, albeit in outer space. Electric Six changes more frequently than change itself, but ultimately this just means they're never gonna put out the same album twice. Fresh Blood for Tired Vampires is poppy & smooth, nasty & raw...& oh so life affirming, especially if you are undead", "date": "2017-03-17T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Electric 6 - 3/17/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/108524739646699/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Laugh as our League and guests tackle long form improv with their hilarious skills.

Often, the cinematic image stands in for real life as it plays out behind windows in the buildings, sometimes creating a sense of mystery, other times stressing the mundane. Snelling\u2019s work derives from voyeurism, film noir, and geographical and architectural location.

Brought in to construct the towering monuments to wealth that punctuate the skylines of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, this labor force works without the rights of citizenship, endures miserable living conditions, and is ultimately forced to leave the country. Until now, the humanitarian crisis of the so-called \u201cguest workers\u201d of the Gulf has barely been addressed in fiction. With his stunning, mind-altering debut novel Temporary People, Deepak Unnikrishnan delves into their histories, myths, struggles, and triumphs. \n\nCombining the irrepressible linguistic invention of Salman Rushdie and the satirical vision of George Saunders, Unnikrishnan presents twenty-eight linked stories that careen from construction workers who shapeshift into luggage and escape a labor camp, to a woman who stitches back together the bodies of those who\u2019ve fallen from buildings in progress, to a man who grows ideal workers designed to live twelve years and then perish\u2014until they don\u2019t, and found a rebel community in the desert. With this polyphony, Unnikrishnan brilliantly maps a new, unruly global English. Giving substance and identity to the anonymous workers of the Gulf, he highlights the disturbing ways in which \u201cprogress\u201d on a global scale is bound up with dehumanization. \n\nDeepak Unnikrishnan is a writer from Abu Dhabi, and an editor at The State. His fiction and essays have appeared in Guernica, Drunken Boat, Himal Southasian, Bound Off, The State Vol IV: Dubai and in the anthology The Apex Book of World SF 4, among others.\n\n \n\nEvent date: \nMonday, March 20, 2017 - 7:00pm\n\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II.\nFor this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body\u2019s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist. Her grandfather\u2019s role in the history of the site underscores Ruben\u2019s personal connection.\nThe exhibition presents Ruben\u2019s photographs of Willow Run in UMMA\u2019s Photography Gallery and an original film\u2014co-created by Ruben and video artist Seth Bernstein and featuring an original score by award-winning composer Stephen Hartke\u2014in the Museum\u2019s Forum.\n\nLead support for Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Herbert W. and Susan L.

Coming of age in a culture that demands women be as small, quiet, and compliant as possible--like a porcelain dove that will also have sex with you--writer and humorist Lindy West quickly discovered that she was anything but. From a painfully shy childhood in which she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her big body and even bigger opinions; to her public war with stand-up comedians over rape jokes; to her struggle to convince herself, and then the world, that fat people have value; to her accidental activism and never-ending battle royale with Internet trolls, Lindy narrates her life with a blend of humor and pathos that manages to make a trip to the abortion clinic funny and wring tears out of a story about diarrhea.\n\nWith inimitable good humor, vulnerability, and boundless charm, Lindy boldly shares how to survive in a world where not all stories are created equal and not all bodies are treated with equal respect, and how to weather hatred, loneliness, harassment, and loss, and walk away laughing. Shrill provocatively dissects what it means to become self-aware the hard way, to go from wanting to be silent and invisible to earning a living defending the silenced in all caps.\n\nLindy West is a Seattle-based writer, editor, and performer whose work focuses on pop culture, social justice, humor, and body image. She's currently a culture writer for GQ magazine and GQ.com and a weekly columnist at The Guardian, as well as the founder and editor of I Believe You | It's Not Your Fault, an advice blog for teens. In 2015 she wrote and recorded a story for This American Life about confronting an Internet troll who impersonated her dead father. She also was listed as \"Internet's Most Fascinating of 2015\" by Cosmopolitan.com, and helped launch the viral #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag in defense of women's reproductive rights.\n \n\nEvent date: \nThursday, March 23, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Taylor is in the company of naturalist poets such as Gary Snyder and Mary Oliver-poets who often drew from an Emersonian sensibility to create art that awakens the mind to its corresponding truths in the natural world. The book ranges from the longer poem to the eight line, unrhymed stanza similar to that of the T'ang poet Han-Shan. And without section breaks to reinforce the passing of time, the collection creates greater fluidity of movement from one poem to the next, as if there is no beginning or end, only an eternal moment that is suspended on the page. Tom Pohrt's original illustrations are scattered throughout the text, adding a stunning visual element to the already vivid language. The book moves from the author's travel accounts to the destruction of the natural world, even species extinction, to more hopeful poems of survival and the return of wildness. The natural rhythm is at times marred by the disturbances of the twenty-first century that come blaring into these meditations, as when a National Guard jet rumbles over the treeline upsetting a hummingbird, and yet, even the hummingbird is able to regain its balance and continue as before. At its core, Taylor's collection is a reminder of Emerson's idea that natural facts are symbols of spiritual facts.\n\nKeith Taylor has authored or edited 16 books and chapbooks, including his most recent small collection, Fidelities (Alice Greene and Co., 2015). His last full length collection was If the World Becomes So Bright, and his next one, The Bird-while, will be published by Wayne State University Press in February, 2017. He has also co-edited several collections of fiction and non-fiction, including a recent collection of contemporary Michigan ghost stories. His poems, stories, reviews and translations have appeared widely in North America and in Europe. He has received Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs. He teaches at the University of Michigan where he also serves as Associate Editor of Michigan Quarterly Review and director of the Bear River Writers Conference. He spends his summers teaching at the University of Michigan Biological Station near Pellston.\n\nIllustrator and children's author Tom Pohrt grew up in the automobile-manufacturing town of Flint, Michigan. A self-taught artist whose love of animals is evident in his artwork, Pohrt has been interested in writing and drawing ever since he was a little boy. Despite his lack of guidance as a youngster, Pohrt has become a well-established illustrator, working with texts by authors such as Philippa Pierce, Julia Durango, and Jim Harrison as well as penning the text for two self-illustrated books featuring his original stories. \"The precise, delicate lines of his drawings, coupled with his slightly moody, sepia-toned palette, suggest antique etchings,\" wrote a Publishers Weekly contributor in reviewing Pohrt's work for Howard Norman's Trickster and the Fainting Birds, the critic dubbing the picture book \"beautifully designed and presented.\"\n\nPohrt is the winner of the Lee Bennett Hopkins Award for Children's Poetry, 2004, for The Wishing Bone and Other Poems by Stephen Mitchell; American Library Association Notable Children's Book designation, 2004, for The Little Gentleman by Philippa Pearce.", "date": "2017-04-03T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Meet Poet Keith Taylor & Illustrator Tom Pohrt"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1724899501156129/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Commemorating the University of Michigan\u2019s 2017 Bicentennial, Victors for Art: Michigan\u2019s Alumni Collectors celebrates the deep impact of Michigan alumni in the global art world.

The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vige\u0301e Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d.

April 15 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nProtomartyr  \nwsg: Paint Thinner & Double Winter\n\nI asked Joe Casey once why he chose to start his first band with a group of guys roughly ten years his junior. His answer was simple: He needed them, needed this, needed Protomartyr. He didn\u2019t want to end up singing classic rock covers in a carport or dive bar one night a week. At 35, with no musical background and crippling stage fright, he needed friends who were young and hearty enough to want to write and record and practice and tour and be heard as badly as he did then. He\u2019d just lost his father to an unexpected heart attack, and his heartbroken mother to the beginnings of Alzheimer\u2019s shortly thereafter. He\u2019d come to understand, all too intimately, how brutal and finite a life can be. Consider then the urgency with which he joined his bandmates\u2014guitarist Greg Ahee, drummer Alex Leonard, and bassist Scott Davidson, fellow alums of the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy\u2014for the first time, in a basement full of unsuspecting onlookers. Consider the urgency with which they\u2019ve approached everything since\u2014three albums in three years, each more extraordinary and rewarding than the last. This music is inherently, unassumingly high stakes. I can think of no other band that moves me like they do.\n\nThis October marks the release of The Agent Intellect, their third and finest work to date.  Named after an ancient philosophical questioning of how the mind operates in relation to the self, it\u2019s an elegant and often devastating display of all that makes Protomartyr so vital and singularly visceral an outfit. Over the course of several months, Ahee waded through more than a hundred song fragments until he reached the bottomless melodies of \u201cI Forgive You\u201d and \u201cClandestine Time\u201d, the inky depths of \u201cPontiac \u201987\u201d and titanic churn of \u201cWhy Does It Shake?\u201d Lyrically, Casey is at his most confident and haunting. He humanizes evil on \u201cThe Devil in His Youth,\u201d and, amid the charred pop of \u201cDope Cloud,\u201d he reassures us that nothing\u2014not God, not money\u2014can or will prevent our minds from unraveling until we finally fade away. We are no one and nothing, he claims, without our thoughts. It\u2019s a theme that echoes through the entirety of the record, but never as beautifully as it does on \u201cEllen.\u201d Named after his mother and written from the perspective of his late father, it\u2019s as romantic a song as you\u2019re likely to hear this or any year, Casey promising to wait for her on the other side, with the memories she\u2019s lost safely in hand.\n\nI remember a story he told me in Detroit. A few months earlier, he\u2019d been driving with his mother as a Protomartyr recording played on the stereo.\n\n\u201cJoe,\u201d she asked him. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is us, Mom,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said, \u201cThis is very good.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014David Bevan, July 2015", "date": "2017-04-15T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Protomartyr 4/15/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1008319905968712/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "March 11\u2013August 20, 2017\nPhotography Gallery\n\nIn 2013, artist Ernestine Ruben (BSDEs \u201953) photographed the once-famed industrial complex Willow Run in Washtenaw County, Michigan.

Based in southeast Michigan, he's stitched himself throughout the fabric of the state's musical community as a sideman for some of the state's best-known performers, including Kitty Donohoe, Matt Watroba, Michael King, and others. He is a member of the ensembles the Raisinpickers and the RFD Boys, and the go-to multi-instrumentalist for countless regional acts.  He performs with Ann Arbor's Wild Swan Theater as their main musician and is also involved as music director of the Ramblin' River Road Show. His smooth, soothing vocals and excellent songwriting are accompanied by his stellar skills on fiddle, mandolin, and guitar. www.davidmoshermusic.blogspot.com\n\nSongwriter and Michigan Emmy recipient Kitty Donohoe is not an Irish or Celtic singer, but she clearly draws from that part of her heritage, as well as her American roots, as an artist.  A writer of tunes as well as songs, her originals are rich with her  natural sense as a storyteller, her love for language and her ear for a melody.  Her music is luminous, earthy and compelling, and all of her songwriter CDs  integrate the textures and feel of accordions, whistles, pipes and bodhran alongside the more standard guitar, bass or piano.  Some of her originals sound like they were written 100 years ago and others are clearly contemporary, but one thing is certain: with or without a band behind her, Kitty's striking voice carries it all, delivering each song with power and emotion. www.kittydonohoe.com\n\nCome enjoy two musical friends sharing the stage for an evening of acoustic camaraderie!", "date": "2017-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Kitty Donohoe & David Mosher at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/254338798323472/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Join us for a rousing evening of Kander & Ebb's best songs, in new, inventive arrangements and mashups, at Conor O'Neill's Irish Pub in Ann Arbor!
