And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started. With roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up. Releases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact. Whether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them. As with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans. 2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1195526610494635/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Golf Clap 1/6/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2017-01-06T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

This event will take place in the Rackham Amphitheater and is free and open to the public. Join us!\n\nIn a series of personal letters to his sons, Omar Saif Ghobash offers a short and highly readable manifesto that tackles our current global crisis with the training of an experienced diplomat and the personal responsibility of a father. Today's young Muslims will be tomorrow's leaders, and yet too many are vulnerable to extremist propaganda that seems omnipresent in our technological age. The burning question, Ghobash argues, is how moderate Muslims can unite to find a voice that is true to Islam while actively and productively engaging in the modern world. What does it mean to be a good Muslim?\n\nWhat is the concept of a good life? And is it acceptable to stand up and openly condemn those who take the Islamic faith and twist it to suit their own misguided political agendas? In taking a hard look at these seemingly simple questions, Ghobash encourages his sons to face issues others insist are not relevant, not applicable, or may even be Islamophobic. These letters serve as a clear-eyed inspiration for the next generation of Muslims to understand how to be faithful to their religion and still navigate through the complexities of today's world. They also reveal an intimate glimpse into a world many are unfamiliar with and offer to provide an understanding of the everyday struggles Muslims face around the globe.\n\nOmar Saif Ghobash is the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Russia. In addition to his post in Moscow, Ambassador Ghobash sponsors the Saif Ghobash-Banipal Prize for Arabic Literary Translation and founded the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in collaboration with the Booker Prize in London. Ambassador Ghobash studied law at Oxford and mathematics at the University of London.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, January 9, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nRackham Amphitheater\n915 E.

In an era defined by mass incarceration, endless war, economic crisis, catastrophic environmental destruction, and a political system offering more of the same, radical social transformation has never been more urgent. Demand the Impossible! urges us to imagine a world beyond what this rotten system would have us believe is possible. In critiquing the world around us, insurgent educator and activist Bill Ayers uncovers cracks in the system, raising our sights for radical change, and envisioning strategies for building a movement to create a more humane, balanced, and peaceful world.\n\n\"For Bill Ayers, it is the freedom of our collective imagination that links the contemporary world\u2014ensconced as it is in pervasive militarism, racist violence, and environmental devastation\u2014to the flourishing of our planet. This is a manifesto that should be read by everyone who wants to believe that \u201canother world is possible.\u201d\u2014Angela Y.

Known for their viral remixes of \u201cTrap Queen\u201d, \u201cI Miss You\u201d and \u201cCool\u201d, the two have, in unprecedented time, mastered a wide range of genres from deep, melodic house to harder progressive cuts. With their Spotify and SoundCloud views now exceeding 35 million and with nineteen #1\u2019s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America. \n\nKicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Blink 182, Tori Kelly and Alesso to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct \u201cSoul House\u201d style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release. After receiving the \u201cAward of Independent Excellence\u201d from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey\u2019s hit \u201cBorn To Die\u201d scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014.\n\nFollowing multiple performances at San Francisco\u2019s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York\u2019s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Denmark, Mexico and Canada, showing off their potential in the international arena.\n\nWith support now coming from the likes of Tiesto, The Chainsmokers, Krewella and many more, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2016, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/TwoFriendsMusic\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/two-friends\nTalk: https://twitter.com/twofriendsmusic\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/twofriendsmusic\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/twofriendsmusic/\n\nDoors open at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services are available. contact: VIP@necto.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1299649313440032/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Two Friends at Necto", "date": "2017-01-12T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "Now playing through January 8!

Emerging patterns, thoughts and ideas begin to show themselves in a way that was impossible to see by only looking at one. Things are always in conversation with each other. Their meanings are derived through interactions with other elements and those meanings change as context changes. Artists often employ comparison, context and groupings to create meaning in their work. While there are many different approaches that can be taken, the outcome is the same; to create a larger entity that arises through the interactions among smaller or simpler entities.\n\nIn Emergent Effect, the artists use these methods to create meaning and find meaning in the spaces between all of their work as well. All the artists have their practices located in Ypsi Alloy Studios and in that shared space they also share ideas. Though they all work in different mediums and materials, a common voice can be found.\n\n-----------\nThe 117 Gallery 2016/2017 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1164636040280941/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Emergent Effect: Opening Reception", "date": "2017-01-13T18:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "Friday, January 13th at 7:00 pm \nA Night of Poetry at Nicola\u2019s\nMalfunctions Tour with August Smith, Dylan Lancaster, KFG, Elysia Smith and C.M.

Additional information is available by visiting www.a2ct.org. \n \nAt a time when electricity was beginning to light up the dark corners of the polite Victorian home, In the Next Room introduces us to characters wondering what they want and how they are supposed to love.  Dr. Givings treats women for hysteria, and now, thanks to the invention of electricity, he has a new vibrating instrument which is getting amazing results.  On just the other side of the door in the living room, his wife Catherine struggles with her role as a wife and mother.  Each of them is beginning to wonder, and worry, about exactly what is happening in the next room.  Loosen your corset and join Ann Arbor Civic Theatre for a play full of both poetry and farce that asks whether we are so different today.\n \nDirector Melissa Freilich is working with a talented ensemble of actors and designers to develop the world of the doctor\u2019s home.  Describing the emotional impact of the show, she says, \u201cThis play brings us into the character's lives.  We don't see what we expect from a Victorian stereotype.  Instead, we recognize real people who are struggling with their own feelings, in a way that's both beautiful and often really funny.\u201d\n \nThe artistic staff of In the Next Room, or the vibrator play includes set designer Leo Babcock, set dressing designer Beth Duey, props designer Aaron Wade, lighting designer Brad Pritts, costume designers Jamee Zielke and Abby Zielke, undergarments designer Molly Borneman, and sound designer Matt Steward.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake.\n\nGrowing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now.\n\nConcurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention.\n\nEarly Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year.\n\nAbout Golf Clap:  DJs; producers; club headliners; after-party enthusiasts: Golf Clap are Hugh Cleal and Bryan Jones, a Detroit duo with an unmatched passion for house music and a seemingly endless supply of studio and club-focused creativity. And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nWith roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up.\n\nReleases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, Spring Awakening, North Coast, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact.\n\nWhether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San, Skream, or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them.\n\nAs with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans.\n\n2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/djworthysf/videos\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/worthy\nTalk: https://twitter.com/w_o_r_t_h_y\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/WorthySF\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/itsworthy/\n\nDoors at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services available contact: VIP@necto.com \u2022 734-994-5436 \u2022 necto.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/981986061934932/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Worthy with Golf Clap at Necto", "date": "2017-01-26T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nWSG: Scott Hirsch\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1300798096618445/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Hiss Golden Messenger 1/28/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2017-01-28T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "Heidi Andermack, born in Michigan, co-founded Chowgirls Killer Catering in 2004.

In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.\ntomchapin.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1093572227425292/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Tom Chapin at Green Wood Coffee House", "date": "2017-03-03T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "\u201cThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis is so far from the usual big-band clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d (Dallas)\n\nSince 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble.
