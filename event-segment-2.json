The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/", "date": "2016-09-24T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Chirp w/ Liquid Monk and Ma Baker at Club Above", "description": "Come catch these 3 local groove machines at Club Above in Ann Arbor and share in a night of pure jollification. \n\n18+\n$5, $7 under 21\nDoors @ 9, set times TBA\n\nChirp is a four-piece band that does it's fair share of genre-hopping, but often plays in the styles of progressive rock/funk, and jazz-fusion.

Drawing from her background in Irish dance, and influenced by a diverse musical range from classical to Cape Breton, Aislinn\u2019s distinct style shines through her music in an open and honest way. Known for her syncopated and rhythmic accompaniment, her compositions and arrangements offer a fresh perspective to the Irish music tradition.\n\nRaised immersed in the Irish culture (the shared heritage on both sides of her family) Aislinn learned about Irish customs through dance, music and language lessons. She was drawn to the harp from an early age, and studied with various Irish and Celtic harpers including Janet Harbison and Michael Rooney. Aislinn also spent a semester abroad at the University of Limerick where she worked closely with Irish harper Fionnuala Rooney.\n\nAislinn\u2019s recently released debut solo harp album The Thin Place has been called \u201cstunning, a monumental piece of work from a very talented and driven harper\u201d and \u201cfor a first CD it\u2019s a winner\u201d (Jack Baker of Irish American News). The album blends popular traditional Irish tunes with those less commonly played, and features four of her own compositions including one with the album\u2019s namesake. Joining Aislinn on select tracks are some of Chicago\u2019s finest Irish musicians: Liz Carroll (fiddle), Teresa Shine (fiddle) and John Williams (concertina). Aislinn\u2019s tune The Thin Place and accompanying track is also featured on the Irish Traditional Music Archive\u2019s Newly Composed Tunes and Songs in the Irish Tradition playlist. Listen to a sample here.\n\nFrom performing annually at Irish festivals including the Milwaukee Irish Fest, to private events and traditional Irish music sessions, Aislinn is in high-demand as a performer and keeps a busy schedule. She is a featured musician for the annual iBAM!

In this propulsive, masterfully plotted epic, an urban wasteland whose history is plagued with riots and unrest is reimagined as an ambiguous new frontier\u2014a site of tenacity, possibility, even hope. Driven by struggle and suspense, and shot through with a startling empathy, Christopher Hebert\u2019s magnificent second novel unspools an American story for our time.\n\n\u201cA humbler, more endearing bunch of rainbow-hued misfits never fumbled their broken-hearted way towards revolution than those we meet in Christopher Hebert\u2019s Angels of Detroit\u2013truly a novel of our moment, both in the way it stares unsentimentally at the real trouble we are in\u2013a world of poisoned children and cities in ruins\u2013and in the deep and detailed empathy it shows for characters of every class and provenance.

In the 1960s, humans took their first steps away from the earth, and for a time our possibilities in space seemed endless. But in a period of austerity and in the wake of high-profile disasters like Challenger, that dream has ended. In early 2011, Margaret Lazarus Dean traveled to Cape Canaveral for NASA\u2019s last three space shuttle launches in order to bear witness to the end of an era. With Dean as our guide to Florida\u2019s Space Coast and to the history of NASA, Leaving Orbit takes the measure of what American spaceflight has achieved while reckoning with its earlier witnesses like Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, and Oriana Fallaci. Along the way Dean meets NASA workers, astronauts, and space fans, gathering possible answers to the question: what does it mean that a spacefaring nation won\u2019t be going to space anymore?\n\n\u201cMargaret Lazarus Dean is that rarest of hybrids, the dearest of hyphenates. She brings to science such exquisite sentence making, to futurism the sound anchorage of the past, to space travel the tidings of personal journey. Journalist, essayist, memoirist and storyteller\u2014her prized text shows Americans, each and every, how we came to be the ones we are. And where we\u2019re going.

On one side, the wealthy wield power and advantage, wittingly or not, to keep the system operating in their favor\u2014all while retreating into enclaves that separate them further and further from the poor and working class. On the other side, those who find it increasingly difficult to keep up or get ahead lash out\u2014waging a rhetorical war against the rich and letting anger and resentment, however justifiable, keep us from seeing new potential solutions.\n\nBut can we suspend both class wars long enough to consider a new way forward? Is it really good for anyone that most of society\u2019s wealth is pooling at the very top of the wealth ladder? Does anyone, including the one percent, really want to live in a society plagued by economic apartheid? It is time to think differently, says longtime inequality expert and activist Chuck Collins. Born into the one percent, Collins gave away his inheritance at 26 and spent the next three decades mobilizing against inequality. He uses his perspective from both sides of the divide to deliver a new narrative. Collins calls for a ceasefire and invites the wealthy to come back home, investing themselves and their wealth in struggling communities.  And he asks the non-wealthy to build alliances with the one percent and others at the top of the wealth ladder.\n\nStories told along the way explore the roots of advantage, show how taxpayers subsidize the wealthy, and reveal how charity, used incorrectly, can actually reinforce extreme inequality. Readers meet pioneers who are crossing the divide to work together in new ways, including residents in the author\u2019s own Boston-area neighborhood who have launched some of the most interesting community transition efforts in the nation. In the end, Collins\u2019s national and local solutions not only challenge inequality but also respond to climate change and offer an unexpected, fresh take on one of our most intransigent problems.\n\n\u201cI have never read a story remotely like the one Chuck Collins has to tell. Born to the one percent, in circumstances few of us can imagine, he grew an outsized conscience and gave up his inherited wealth for a life of fighting the vicious inequality that is destroying our country. Somewhere along the way, he came to understand that the rich can be part of the solution instead of the problem and started organizing them to join in the struggle for a fair economy. The result is an electrifying challenge to the affluent as well as the one percent. \u2018Come out of your gated communities and gated hearts,\u2019 he writes, because outside lies the warmth of human solidarity.\u201d--Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed\n\nChuck Collins is a researcher, campaigner, storyteller, and writer based at the Institute for Policy Studies where he co-edits Inequality.org. He has written extensively on wealth inequality in previous books like 99 to 1, Wealth and Our Commonwealth (with Bill Gates Sr.), and Economic Apartheid in America as well as in The Nation, The American Prospect, and numerous other magazines and news outlets. Collins grew up in the 1 percent as the great grandson of meatpacker Oscar Mayer, but at age 26 he gave away his inheritance. He has been working to reduce inequality and strengthen communities since 1982 and in the process has cofounded numerous initiatives, including Wealth for the Common Good (now merged with the Patriotic Millionaires), United for a Fair Economy, and Divest-Invest. He is also a leader in the transition movement, and a co-founder of the Jamaica Plain New Economy Transition and the Jamaica Plain Forum, both in the Boston-area community in which he lives.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/179229159178583/", "date": "2016-09-28T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Tritonal: Painting With Dreams - Ann Arbor", "description": "We're bringing the Painting With Dreams tour to Necto Nightclub in Ann Arbor!\n\nNew album, a brand new stage production, and most important, all of our Tritonians of Michigan under one roof!!!!\n\nMore info and tickets - http://paintingwithdreams.com/\n\nSee you this fall!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1731098520471774/", "date": "2016-09-28T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Impact Day benefiting Girls on the Run", "description": "Girls on the Run of Southeastern Michigan provides a 10 week after-school program for girls in 3rd-5th grade, teaching inspiration through physical, emotional, social and mental development. 10% of our sales on this day will go to support girls in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/671611199664649/", "date": "2016-09-29T08:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Jan Banning", "description": "Literati is pleased to welcome photographer Jan Banning in support of Bureaucratics and Law & Order, and in conjunction with an exhibition at the University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities Gallery.\n\nBureaucratics is a project consisting of a book and a traveling exhibition that has so far been shown in museums and galleries in some twenty countries on five continents. The book and the exhibition contain 50 photographs and are the product of an anarchist\u2019s heart, a historian\u2019s mind and an artist\u2019s eye. Bureaucratics is a comparative photographic study of the culture, rituals and symbols of state civil administrations and its servants in eight countries on five continents, selected on the basis of political, historical and cultural considerations: Bolivia, China, France, India, Liberia, Russia, the United States, and Yemen. In each country, Jan visited up to hundreds of offices of members of the executive in different services and at different levels. The visits were unannounced and the accompanying writer, Will Tinnemans, by interviewing kept the employees from tidying up or clearing the office. That way, the photos show what a local citizen would be confronted with when entering.\n\nThe photography has a conceptual, typological approach reminding of August Sander\u2019s \u2018Menschen des 20 Jahrhunderts\u2019 (\u2018People of the Twentieth Century\u2019). Each subject is posed behind his or her desk. The photos all have a square format (fitting the subject), are shot from the same height (that of the client), with the desk \u2013 its front or side photographed parallel to the horizontal edges of the frame \u2013 serving as a bulwark protecting the representative of rule and regulation against the individual citizen, the warm-blooded exception. They are full of telling details that sometimes reveal the way the state proclaims its power or the bureaucrat\u2019s rank and function, sometimes of a more private character and are accompanied by information such as name, age, function and salary. Though there is a high degree of humour and absurdity in these photos, they also show compassion with the inhabitants of the state\u2019s paper labyrinth.\n\nThe project Bureaucratics has been made possible with financial support from the Foundation for Democracy and Media, Stichting Fonds Anna Cornelis, NCDO and SBKU Utrecht (Committee for the Promotion of Visual Arts).\n\n*\n\nLaw & Order is a photo project that compares the criminal justice system in four different countries on four continents: Colombia (South-America), France (Europe), Uganda (Africa) and the United States (North-America). It combines an artistic view with a documentary approach and sheds light on the key institutions within the criminal justice system: the police, the courts and prisons. Thanks to the avoidance of visual clich\u00e9s \u2013 hands gripping prison bars, humbly bowed, seated prisoners and the like \u2013 that do little other than confirm the existing image, it can contribute to the international debate on criminal law. It raises questions such as: how do we deal with criminals? What is the relationship between punishment and crime? Is confinement, besides being an instrument of punishment, also effective as a means of correction?\n\nThe choice of the four countries was made in consultation with the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law (MPI) in Freiburg, Germany, a scientific institute respected worldwide. Criteria were \u2013 besides being able to gain access \u2013 the diversity of legal systems (civil law and common law), the murder rate and a division between developed and developing countries.\n\nThe police and the judiciary come up frequently in the public debate and are a favorite subject for populist politics. There is rarely sympathy for criminals and politicians\u2019 arguments for harsher penalties \u201cbecause this cannot continue\u201d find a receptive ear with large parts of the population in many countries. However, statistics show that developments in the field of serious crime are not necessarily unfavorable: murder and violent crimes in large parts of Europe are declining steadily over the past decade or two \u2013 and even longer in the US.\n\nLaw & Order is presented in the form of a book and an international traveling exhibition. In addition to the photographs, both contain relevant information and infographics (source: Max Planck Institute); the book also contains an introduction by Dutchman Michiel Scholtes about his experiences as a convict in a French prison.\n\n*\n\nJan Banning is a Dutch autonomous artist/photographer, based in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is No Other Love. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.

His single \u201cMove\u201d  is currently featured on a Chevy in the D commercial and will be featured on a second EP to be released later this fall.  With a couple of internships at major record labels in Los Angeles and Nashville, Cooper is looking to continue building his career as a songwriter with a music publisher.

Besides their wildly unique sound that blends classical, alternative, and pop influences, their everyday style takes them way out of orbit from everyone else. Their first album, A Faint Impression, was released in November 2015. Hear that album right here: https://thegravityclub.bandcamp.com/album/a-faint-impression\n\nNathan K. - is one of Michigan's most beloved singer-songwriters who is \"on the cusp of being part of the next generation of artists to achieve success along the lines of Bright Eyes, Sufjan Stevens, Jens Lekman, etc.\" (Songs Illinois) Listen for yourself here: https://nathank.bandcamp.com/album/methodist-girls\n\nZander Michigan - a singer/songwriter from Detroit, MI.

For nuscope, Hemingway previously recorded the challenging Subsymbolism (CD 1010) with Georg Graewe and Ernst Reijseger.\n\nTogether, the two will perform an evening of innovative compositions and improvisations with a quiet intensity that beats its own path while paying homage to tradition.\n\nThis performance is made possible through the generous sponsorship of The Maxine and Stuart FrankelFoundation for Art in honor of Maurice and Linda Binkow on the occasion of her 80th birthday and their 60th wedding anniversary.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Wolf Eyes, Windy & Carl, Aaron Dilloway: benefit concert", "description": "Maize & Blue Velvet: a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation\nTicket proceeds to benefit the Chicago division of the David Lynch Foundation and the Ann Arbor Film Festival\n\nwith special guests\n\nWindy & Carl\n\nWolf Eyes\n\nAaron Dilloway\n\nAbout the Foundation\nThe David Lynch Foundation\u2019s core mission is to heal traumatic stress and raise performance in at risk populations, including veterans suffering from PTSD and mothers and their families who have lost loved ones to violence.

Silvie is deeply engaged in practice of making functional pots and the theater and atmosphere of the dining experience. Silvie states: \u201cI am interested in discussing how we learn techniques, develop ideas and evolve as innovators rather than imitators. Ideas come easily, but meaning seems to come in layers over decades of time. It is meaning that gives strength to good ideas.\u201d Silvie invites participants to bring images of their work for discussion and questions and themes that we might discuss and all benefit from. How we evolve as makers in our increasingly technological world is a favorite topic of mine.\n\nSilvie Granatelli received her BFA from Kansas City Art Institute and her MFA from Montana State University.

Ryan Packard is known mostly for his extensive work as a composer and percussionist within the thriving contemporary classical scene in Chicago, while Albert Wildeman has achieved fame for his meteoric rise from novice instrumentalist to one of the busiest players in town after relocating to Chicago from the Netherlands in 2011 to immerse himself in the city\u2019s broad-shouldered music world. These two contribute noticeably fresh perspectives to this ongoing and ever-evolving local dialogue, a world of which Rempis has been a flagship member for almost two decades. As a trio, their voice carries a unique shape, combining a love for full-on blasts of energy with a sensitivity to the smallest details, resulting in music that can be a freight train one moment, and an insectoid microcosm the next. The band released their first recording, Polynya, on Aerophonic Records in the summer of 2016, and is on tour throughout North America this fall.\n\nThis performance is made possible through the generous sponsorship of The Maxine and Stuart Frankel Foundation for Art in honor of Maurice and Linda Binkow on the occasion of her 80th birthday and their 60th wedding anniversary.

October 27 | 8pm | All Ages | $25 Cover\n\nann arbor's 107one Presents:\nBrett Dennen wsg: Lily & Madeleine\n\nAs common and simple as it is, \"por favor\" is such an evocative expression. From Spanish, it translates to \"please,\" a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. \"Por favor' was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,\" says Brett Dennen. \"We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.\"\n\n\"When you say please, you're asking something to come into your life,\" Dennen adds. \"It might mean that you're weak and need something to make you strong. But you're admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.\"\n\nThat notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen's intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.\n\n\"All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn't feeling confident about myself,\" he says. \"When I'm not feeling confident, I'm not a nice person to be around. I don't take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I'm in that place.\"\n\nA followup to 2013's Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It's the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it's by no means a sad affair, nor is it the \"rainyday record\" Dennen initially thought he was making.\n\nOften framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. \"And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let's go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,\" he sings over a chugging groove on \"Bonfire.\"\n\nOn \"Where We Left Off,\" the album's emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: \"Everyone knows I'm a happy man/ But I haven't been right.\"\n\n\"Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,\" Dennen admits. \"Is there something I'm scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren't in that zone.\"\n\n\"I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,\" he continues. \"I don't have to worry about whether they'll be on the radio or if they're different from my previous stuff.\"\n\nHoled up at Cobb's Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb's insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. \"We recorded it the way people made records in the '60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,\" he says. \"We didn't do anything more than five times. We didn't secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It's not sloppy, but it's in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.\"\n\nCobb adds, \"I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He's very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.\"\n\nMore than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. \"My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,\" he says.\n\nThat marked a detour from his most recent releases. With those he felt like he was exercising his craftsmanship - \"being a songwriter for the sake of being a songwriter,\" as he puts it. \"I really wanted this new album to come across as a whole piece,\" Dennen says. \"I consider it to be a batch of songs that all live together and complement each other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the album title. Please.\n\n\"What was I asking for with this album\" Dennen says. \"I wanted to be a good person and feel good about myself again, but in a way that I knew it was OK to be sad. That's part of life, the ups and downs. But with these songs, I want to make people feel good about themselves and about life through the good and bad.\"\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/718", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1735261526750729/", "date": "2016-10-27T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Fun House : Halloween Thrills & Chills", "description": "Come One...

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\n\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\n\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\n\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal. It\u2019s a transformation record.\u201d We are so pleased to welcome Mary Gauthier into our Series. www.marygauthier.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/676020209212879/", "date": "2016-11-12T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Seth Walker", "description": "\"He's the real deal\"\u2014Marcia Ball", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/494085454134532/", "date": "2016-11-14T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Blue Rodeo w/Devin Cuddy", "description": "Pioneers of North American alt-country songwriting", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1276016955755855/", "date": "2016-11-15T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Dave Simonett of Trampled By Turtles and Carl Broemel of My Morning Jacket", "description": "Tickets on sale Friday, 8/19, at 10 a.m. at TheArk.org!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1790043767908763/", "date": "2016-11-16T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Jay Stielstra: Songs from His Play \"Old Man in Love\" & More", "description": "Michigan's folk songwriting treasure", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1796899840545340/", "date": "2016-11-17T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "description": "Thursday, November 17 | 9pm | 18+ | $14 adv./ $16 day of\n\nEl Ten Eleven wsg: Bayonne\n\n\"It\u2019s surprising this record even got made,\u201d bass player and songwriter Kristian Dunn reflects. \u201c[Drummer] Tim\u2019s dad died just before the recording was to begin. Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/619658961515550/", "date": "2016-11-17T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Jonatha Brooke", "description": "New music from a folk icon", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/962264457225114/", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Don Henry at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "Grammy Award winner Don Henry's songs have been recorded by legends such as Ray Charles, Patti Page and Conway Twitty; by country crooners including Gene Watson, John Conlee and B.J.

This will be a no-drop group ride and is a great chance for novice MTBer's to get exposure to single track riding and be a fun way to burn off that Thanksgiving feast and get a jump start on getting fit for 2017.  The ride will be about 14 miles long covering ~5.5 miles at Hewens Creek and ~6.5 miles at Rolling Hills along with a few miles of dirt road connecting the two parks.  For those who haven't ridden or rarely ride at either trail, Hewens Creek is a flat, winding ride through meadows and new growth forest which is great for beginning riders.  The RHP trail on the other hand twists and turns through 4+ miles of forest and rolling hills that provide a great opportunity to improve your bike handling skills and 2.5+ miles of open meadows.  The 1.2-mile West Meadows loop on the west side of RHP includes beautiful open meadows and some fun pump-track like riding on the Munger Mounds.   \n\nMeet at the Rolling Hills Lodge at 9:45 AM and then we will head out by 10-10:15 AM.  After the ride, we will have some pizza and refreshments at the lodge at about 12:30 PM.  Please register in advance at Event Brite to attend so a good estimate of riders can be made for the pizza and beverages.  Rain date will be Saturday 11/26 at 10 AM.  Look for changes in schedule on the Rolling Hills or Hewens Creek forums on the MMBA website, the Poto Yahoo! Group Email list, the Poto MBA Facebook page or Poto MBA Twitter account.\n\nPlease park in the MTB trail head parking lot:  enter the park, go straight through the traffic circle and park in the first lot on your right next to a big pavilion ~1/4 mile west of the circle.  The Lodge will be about 200 yards away on your left.  \n\nThere will be a gate charge to enter RHP.  It is a Washtenaw County Park so if you already have WCP sticker you are good to go.  Otherwise, park entry will cost $5 for everyone as a discount for non-Washtenaw residents was arranged.\n\nLast but definitely not least, we have to thank DeWight and crew at Wheels in Motion for supporting the MTB community by sponsoring this event and paying for the food and refreshments since its inaugural event in 2009.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1197643866959330/", "date": "2016-11-25T10:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Mr. B", "description": "Mr. B's Thanksgiving weekend shows are legendary!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/823779797757077/", "date": "2016-11-26T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Gemini", "description": "Music for the family. \"Beautiful songs and singing!\"\u2014WQXR, New York", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/175058409589129/", "date": "2016-11-27T13:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Billy Strings", "description": "\"The unholy child of Pantera and Tony Rice\"\u2014The Bluegrass Situation", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/190154821408376/", "date": "2016-11-27T19:30:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Jen Cass & The Lucky Nows", "description": "New music and a new band from a legendary Detroit songwriter", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/851911334943175/", "date": "2016-12-01T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Enter the Haggis", "description": "The haggis returns!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/271040036590005/", "date": "2016-12-02T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Don White & Christine Lavin at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "Back by popular demand!

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound. With support from the likes of Diplo, Omarion, and JoJo, plus tours with artists like Chance the Rapper, Flume and Chet Faker, the producer has clearly caught the eye some of a wide variety of tastemakers. Featured by the likes of Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Boiler Room and The FADER, Cuna has also received admiration from music journalists the world over, drawing almost universal praise from disparate outlets. With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory. And that\u2019s part of the reason why Cuna connects with his fan base on such a visceral level, eschewing traditional industry methods for his own unique, intimate manner of going about business.\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/768", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1759418600997980/", "date": "2016-12-02T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Jeffrey Foucault w/Dusty Heart", "description": "New music!

While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1574155032886638/", "date": "2016-12-14T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Katie Geddes and Friends at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "Katie Geddes sings traditional and contemporary folk, country-folk, and folk-pop tunes.
