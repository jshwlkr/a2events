NNA2 returns from break Thursday, June 16 \u2014 mark your calendar! We\u2019ve got a solid session featuring quick thinking, robotic legs and sticky brains!  First up, Patti Smith schools us on the history of improv comedy, illuminating the ways its concepts pops up in our day-to-day lives. Shai Rezen opines on the greatness of legs, and walking us through his related research \u2014 making robot legs and mobility better and better. Capping things off, social worker Sara Tischler breaks down obsession, compulsion, OCD research, and techniques that help people \"un-stick\" the brain. Grab a fellow nerd, order a refreshing drink, and we\u2019ll see you there!\n\n\nWhen: Thursday, June 16, 2016, doors at 6:30 pm, talks at 7 pm!\nWhere: LIVE, 102 S First St, Ann Arbor\n$$$: NO COVER! Thanks for having our back, Ann Arbor District Library!\n\n\nPatti Smith \u2014 Improv is Life: History & Facts About Improv Beyond \"Whose Line is it Anyway?\"\nWe use improv our entire lives, even we don't realize it. One could say that humans started doing improv when we started using the spoken language. But how did improv as art form get started? And what does it look like now? Most importantly--how and why should YOU try it? Patti Smith will talk about the history of the art form, examples of improv, and local opportunities to try it yourself. \n\nAbout Patti: Patti Smith is a special education teacher and writer who lives in Ann Arbor with her husband and cats. Patti is the author of two books about history in Ann Arbor, the most recent of which is The History of Ann Arbor's People's Food Co-op. She loves storytelling, most forms of public speaking, especially improv! She believes that improv is for everyone!\n\n\nSara Tischler \u2014 Un-sticking your Brain: OCD and its Treatment\nObsessions are \"sticky\" thoughts, images or impulses that occur over and over again and feel uncontrollable. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or rituals that someone uses to get rid of the obsessions. Together they make up obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD. Hear about OCD and exposure and response prevention (ERP), an evidence-based treatment for the mental health disorder that affects approximately 3.3 million people in the United States.\n\nAbout Sara: Sara is a clinical social worker in the department of outpatient psychiatry at the University of Michigan Health System. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology from Michigan State University (Go Green! Sorry, Ann Arbor) and a Master\u2019s in Social Work from the University of Michigan. She completed her internship and fellowship at the University of Michigan Child and Adolescent Outpatient Psychiatry clinic, where she is now a staff social worker. She provides psychotherapy for children of all ages and their families. Besides OCD, her clinical interests include anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, depression, and trauma/grief. She was born and raised in Southeast Michigan and lives with her partner, Alex. Together they have two beautiful (furry) \u201cchildren\u201d \u2014 Phoebe the dog and Bu the cat, whom she talks about constantly.\n\n\n\nShai Rezen \u2014  A Few Reasons Why I Love Legs\nNo animals other than ourselves move on wheels. That might seems strange, given how efficient and effective wheels are for moving around on land. Nevertheless, there are many good reasons to love legs. These include more obvious reasons, like the ability to use sparse footholds on rough surfaces, and less obvious reasons, such as newly discovered ways that legs make it easier for animals to control their movements. Insights from the animal world are leading to new and amazingly capable walking and running robots.\n\nAbout Shai:  Shai Revzen is an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department and in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department of the University of Michigan, and heads the BIRDS Lab. This confusion about where he belongs isn't new -- he is a bit of many things that don't seem to fit together neatly in a box. His research focuses on the biomechanics of organisms, the legged locomotion of robots, and the mathematical tools that connect the two. Before becoming an academic by running cockroaches on treadmills for six years at the University of California at Berkeley, he worked as a Chief Architect in mid-sized company in Silicon Valley, went around the world, and was unabashedly nerdy.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1741421642801033/", "name": "Improv, OCD, and Legs"}, {"date": "2016-06-16T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Join us for a fun night of live music in downtown Ann Arbor to benefit No Boundaries Flint: All Arts Camp\n\nFeatured bands include: \nBroccoli Unofficial \n-- Hruodberht Loozinsky\n\nSweet Demon\n-- Rose Carver, vocals and acoustic guitar\n-- Leo Crown, electric guitar\n\nFallow Land \n-- Whitaker Fineberg, lead vocals and guitar\n-- Evan Veasey, lead guitar and vocals \n-- Armand Terrell, drums and vocals\n-- Caelin Amin, bass and vocals\n\nBobbiejak \n-- @Tessa Patterson, vocals and keys\n-- Tariq Gardner, drums\n-- Annick Odom, bass\n\nIron Star\n-- John Bochnowski, bass\n-- Gabriel Wilk, guitar\n-- Everett Reid\n-- Ian Gold\n\nDoors open at 9, music starts at 9:30\n$5-10 suggested donation at the door to support NBF!\n\nAbout No Boundaries Flint: All Arts Camp: \nNo Boundaries Flint is a free and exciting one week summer arts camp for Flint kids age 7-10 housed in the Flint Cultural Center.

When we regard a single image it may convey some meaning, but the moment we place another image next to it--even a very different one--our minds begin to construct narrative between those two images. Most of the narrative found in comics happens in the reader\u2019s mind, prompted by deft choices made by the cartoonist author.\n\nHOW MIGHT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMICS CHANGE IF WE WERE MORE AWARE OF THE THINKING WE\u2019RE DOING WHEN READING THEM?\n\nComics Unbound explores how cartoonists use shape, size, line, color, and context to activate the readers\u2019 imaginations and invite them into the partnership of comics narrative. Pages are removed from their intended context, that of the graphic novel or comic book, and re-contextualized with the materials that went into making the final pages. Sketches, notes, scripts, and tools are displayed alongside the final artwork. This new context reveals what is usually an invisible narrative in comics--the journey from artist\u2019s vision to clear transmission of meaning.\n\nThe exhibition runs June 10 to June 24 (the public artist reception is June 17)\n\nThis exhibition contains pieces by cartoonists appearing at the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival held at the Ann Arbor District Library June 18 and 19, 2016.\n\nCURATOR BIOS:\n\nJerzy Drozd is one of the artists of The Warren Commission Report. He leads cartooning classes for children, teens, and adults, as well as for teachers who want to bring comics to the classroom. He co-founded the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival and serves as the event\u2019s programming coordinator. Drozd wrote and drew the graphic novel The Front, has worked on Antarctic Press\u2019s Ninja High School and PPV: Pay- Per-View, and has drawn special projects for Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, Marvel Comics, VIZ Media, and others.\n\nAnne Drozd is a librarian and artist. She and her husband Jerzy created Tiny Astronaut Press, to create many space-themed art works, including Rocketosaurus, a fanciful comic for young readers about an Apollo crew. As a librarian at the Ann Arbor District Library, she develops arts programming and has drawn instructional comics for the science tools collection. Anne and Jerzy live in Ann Arbor with their two cats.\n\n-------------\nIn partnership with Ann Arbor District Library\n\nCatering generously provided by Laura's Catering (http://laurascatering.com/)", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/230585263967439/", "name": "Comics Unbound: Artist Reception"}, {"date": "2016-06-17T18:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Thursdays through Sundays through June 26.

Hoffman in support of his most recent title, Finding Purpose: Environmental Stewardship as a Personal Calling.\n\nBoth thoughtful and thought-provoking, Finding Purpose aims to challenge our understanding of how humanity interacts with planet Earth, and our role within this. This book is an invitation: would you like to participate in one of the most important projects of imagination, perhaps the greatest ever, in human history? Distilling and refining over 20 pieces from a lifetime of work in academia and trade, across speeches, blogs, editorials and essays, Hoffman invites us to look beyond material growth and explore the role of the individual and business in discovering a wider purpose to bring about a balanced and sustainable society.\n\nThe reader is encouraged to consider humanity\u2019s relationship with the environment through different lenses: business, academia, faith-based and cultural. By bringing them together, Hoffman encourages us to understand our relationship with the planet in a far more holistic sense.\n\nDrawing on ideas from philosophy, literature, natural sciences and politics, Hoffman ensures that the ideas he explores are wholly accessible and applicable. Fully substantiated through various research and examples, the issues described are consistently made relevant to the reader.\n\nFinding Purpose is the perfect book for anyone - from student to CEO - thinking about their place in the world, and how making changes in our own lives and societies can impact on the world around us.\n\nAndrew J. Hoffman is the Holcim Professor of Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan's The Ross School of Business. His research focuses on institutional theory; institutional and cultural change; organization theory; and corporate environmental strategies. He has published over a dozen books, which have been translated into five languages. Among his list of honors, he has been awarded the Maggie Award (2013), JMIBreaking the Frame Award (2012), Connecticut Book Award (2011), the Aldo Leopold Fellowship (2011), the Aspen Environmental Fellowship (2011 and 2009), the Manos Page Prize (2009), the Faculty Pioneer Award (2003), the Rachel Carson Book Prize (2001) and the Klegerman Award (1995).

Now, he issues the sharpest entry of his vision, the majestic The Blackberry Train engineered by Steve Albini (Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been an evolution,\u201d James says. \u201cThis set of songs definitely has a harder edge, but it\u2019s a continuation of the last album. The main thing for me is to not conform or compromise.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 panoramic artistry is inspired by such diverse musicians as Kurt Cobain, The Smiths, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, The Cure, The Beatles, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, and Hank Williams. His fingerprint aesthetic has earned him plaudits from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Daily News. He\u2019s earned a strong following the old fashioned way, through tirelessly touring the US, Europe and the UK, and playing bigger and bigger shows with each go around.\n\nThe Blackberry Train is an epiphanic co-mingling of aesthetics. James sought out the distinct audio stylings of Steve Albini to conjure a grungier sensibility. He welcomed the engineer\u2019s gifts for capturing music with a raw clarity, and Steve Albini\u2019s reputation for not impinging on an artist\u2019s vision. The results make for an eclectic album with fastidiously crafted songs documented in the studio with glorious purity.\n\n\u201cI like the music to have elements of the avant garde, psychedelic, and be just a little against the grain,\u201d James reveals. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about having as much emotion as possible for me, musically and lyrically. It\u2019s all about the music being cathartic, heartfelt and true.\u201d\n\nThe Blackberry Train manages to be both diverse and cohesive. The album opens invigoratingly with the jangling rocker, \u201cToo Hard\u201d and closes with the stately and aptly named folk song \u201cPeace and Stillness.\u201d Between these bookends, highlights include the rough-edged and urgently melodic \u201cUnicorn,\u201d the anthemic \u201cPeyote Coyote,\u201d and the soulful ballad \u201cPrayer.\u201d One very personal song is the winsome and reflective \u201cWaterfall\u201d which was inspired by memories of his mother.\n\nThis summer and fall James will embark on extensive tour dates in the U.S. Thinking ahead, James says: \u201cI just want to keep on going, keep working, and improving as a songwriter. I\u2019d love to feel that I realized my full potential both as a person, and as a songwriter. That feels like a great, fulfilling goal to shoot for. Making a lot of music, and striving for more depth artistically\u2013those are my goals.\u201d", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1689584001315124/", "name": "James McCartney w/ Isla 6/20/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-06-21T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n-June 21 Joel Parkkila\n\nJoel Parkkila, from the Ann Arbor punk rock and roll band Human Skull, will play acoustic folk and rock.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1073002982766327/", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Joel Parkkila"}, {"date": "2016-06-21T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Summer is here; come celebrate the longest day of the year with us!

Seeing this as a great opportunity to start over again, they decide to cash in their savings and buy an abandoned house for $35,000 in Detroit, the largest city in the United States to declare bankruptcy.\n\nAs she and her husband restore the 1914 Georgian Revival, a stately brick house with no plumbing, no heat, and no electricity, Amy finds a community of Detroiters who, like herself, aren t afraid of a little hard work or things that are a little rough around the edges. Filled with amusing and touching anecdotes about navigating a real-estate market that is rife with scams, finding a contractor who is a lover of C.S. Lewis and willing to quote him liberally, and neighbors who either get teary-eyed at the sight of newcomers or urge Amy and her husband to get out while they can, Amy writes evocatively about the charms and challenges of finding her footing in a city whose future is in question.

Originally named Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. with typical irreverence, the duo of Joshua Epstein (also of the Silent Years) and Daniel Zott came together in Detroit in 2009. Working out of a basement studio, the pair worked to create a sound that was danceable without sacrificing anything in the songwriting department, merging intricate and airy melodies with solid programmed beats and synth atmospherics.\nTheir hard work bore fruit in 2010 when they released their debut EP, Horse Power, on Quite Scientific, quickly followed by the EP My Love Is Easy: Remixes Pt. 1. That same year, the pair was also tapped to do a remix of Moby's \"Wait for Me.\" The resulting buzz from their early releases led to a record deal with Warner Bros., who released their Record Store Day-exclusive EP titled We Almost Lost Detroit in spring 2011. The duo's full-length debut, It's a Corporate World, followed that summer. In 2013, they returned with an EP, Patterns, before releasing their sophomore full-length, The Speed of Things, later that year. \nIn 2015, even though they had the blessing of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. himself, to avoid ongoing confusion by fans and seekers of the race car driver, Epstein and Zott decided to change the band's name to simply JR JR. Their first LP under the shortened handle and their third with Warner Bros., the endearing JR JR was released that September\nwww.jrjrmusic.com \n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor. Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts. Each week a different area restaurant is on-site selling a Sonic Lunch for concert-goers to purchase. Other restaurants offer special discounts for concert-goers to pick up to take to the park.\n\nSonic Lunch concerts are free and suitable for all ages. Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers. As a result, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch has become one of the coolest summer events in Ann Arbor.\n\nUpdates on show and weather\nSonic Lunch on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/soniclunch\nSonic Lunch on Twitter\nhttp://www.twitter.com/soniclunch \n\n\"LIKE\"\nBank of Ann Arbor on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bankofannarbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1717896315157605/", "name": "JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall / June 23rd / Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch / 11:30AM FREE"}, {"date": "2016-06-23T12:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "NEW SPRING MENUS!\n\nNew season, new Menu.

A live band, a burlesque troupe, a circus act, that is all together too contemporary, too modern, too bawdy, and too controversial to be defined just as \u201cburlesque\u201d. So, calling itself \u2018burlesque\u2019 for lack of a better term, SHFB is heading out for their 7th national tour this fall with its newest musical production. Designed to find your line and cross it, some kind of strange mix of GWAR and Benny Goodman with touches of SNL and the Price is Right, SHFB sprays you with glitter and love while playfully degrading taboo subjects like religion, politics, and sex. \u201cFor every 100 people dancing, there are usually ten or so walking out the door,\u201d says host and bandleader Mr. Happypants, \u201cYou either get it or you don\u2019t; the right people get it.\u201d SHFB sets itself apart from other burlesque shows, and touring acts in general, for one major reason: its live band playing original music. Somewhere in a middle ground between Frank Zappa and Tom Waits, this show that gets curiosity seekers out with the promise of tits keeps them in the seats with a set of original tunes that get stuck in your head for weeks after the performance. \u201cPeople are surprised by the songwriting! What they don\u2019t know is that we\u2019re all professional artists who\u2019s day jobs are in the musical theater world, we bring that aesthetic and blend it with an underground edginess that leaves peoples jaws on the floor.\u201d SHFB is presenting a new and contemporary musical theater at its finest.

A natural poet, this young songwriter went to school on Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson, and Jack White, among others. His lyrics speak directly to a younger generation that hears, sees, and thinks about the very things he\u2019s writing. From their opening song to the finale of their set, the Ben Daniels Band cuts through with their originality, musicianship, and a sound that spans Americana, Blues, Jazz, and Rock.\nThroughout years of touring, BDB has played numerous venues in Michigan, New York City, Washington D.C., and Nashville . As a solo artist, Ben has stepped on the stage in Austin, TX at the Cactus Cafe, as well as The Barns at Wolf Trap. The son of actor Jeff Daniels, he has quietly monitored what it takes to live life as an artist. Beyond a passed down talent, the Ben Daniels Band believes in hard work, perseverance, and creatively challenging themselves and their audience.\nWith George Merkel on guitar, Tommy Reifel on bass, Wesley Fritzemeier on drums/mandolin, and Amanda Merte on percussion/vocals, BDB\u2019s live show never fails to take over the venue. With five CDs under their belts - Coming From The C, Checkin\u2019 In To The Michigan Inn, Can't You See, The Mountain Home EP, and their dual album & movie release Old Gold - the Ben Daniels Band is has grown to be a formidable group that sounds pleasantly familiar, yet unforgettably unique.\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor. Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts. Each week a different area restaurant is on-site selling a Sonic Lunch for concert-goers to purchase. Other restaurants offer special discounts for concert-goers to pick up to take to the park.\n\nSonic Lunch concerts are free and suitable for all ages. Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers.

Just as much influenced by classic rock & roll, country, Latin and Southern hip hop as they are the Stax/Volt or Muscle Shoals era, The Suffers are bringing a fresh approach to what they have coined Gulf Coast Soul. Late night legend David Letterman proclaimed in early 2015 \"If you cant do this, get out of the business\", let it be known that The Suffers are here to stay! With a year that included performances for NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, Newport Folk Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival and The Late Show, The Suffers have delivered over 150 stirring performances of their signature 3rd Coast Soul sound to thousands of new and old fans alike. The large ensemble packs each position of the rhythm and horn section with a level of talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin's massive voice. The band's sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. Their 2016 self-titled debut album is set to hit shelves on February 12th and will be the continuation of what 2015's Make Some Room EP started.

In 2006, Dennen signed with Dualtone and released So Much More. Hope for the Hopeless followed on the same imprint in 2008. Dennen's fourth studio effort, Loverboy, which featured subtle African rhythms and more of a pop veneer, arrived in April of 2011, followed in 2013 by the sparser acoustic-based Smoke and Mirrors and 2014 \nrelease of Out of My Head.

The scene (and scenery) keeps us fueled with love and inspiration.\u201d\n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, its no wonder why they are headlining festivals and one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album \u201cTerra Incognita \u201c goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments, and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

Now, in the midst of a new identity crisis, the champion of negative thought is going back to China.\nWhether he's beating the streets of Beijing in pursuit of a stolen backpack or confronting Communism in an Emperor's tomb, engaging in a battle of wits with overzealous tour guides or performing a pig sacrifice in his ancestral village, internationally touring storyteller phillip low returns with more mystery, more musings, and of course more angst, in his first travelogue since the 2007 hit Descendant of Dragons (Minnesota Fringe Festival Encore winner).\n\n\"It's a mystery story that satisfies because it is about more than the nuts and bolts of solving a puzzle. It's a family story that doesn't shy away from the difficult moments, but also doesn't dissolve into sentimentality. It's a window into another culture, without being a dry sociology lesson. It's a globe-trotting journey that doesn't fall into \"look at these slides of my vacation\" territory.

Hailing from Chelmsford Essex in the UK, in the six years since the release of his genre-defining debut album \u2018Lucky Shiner\u2019, the electronic artist most comfortable with the moniker Derwin Panda spent the subsequent years splitting the majority of his time between London, Berlin and countless excursions to Japan. As he created his third album \u2018\u2019Good Luck And Do Your Best\u2019 he ultimately found himself back where he began, in the East of England.\n\nOrigin stories can be fundamentally boring by nature, packed with non-essential details and overly stressed homilies to roots and influences.

After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-09-26T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Where song, spirit, and speaking meet.

King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is Sound of the Broken. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-10-12T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "A spicy roots cocktail from Venice, CA.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1716825161907547/", "name": "The Dustbowl Revival"}, {"date": "2016-10-13T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Saline High School's nationally recognized fiddle ensemble", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/2588083667997550/", "name": "The Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic"}, {"date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Freshmen no more!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1746959058909209/", "name": "The Verve Pipe"}, {"date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "lauriemcclain.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197527007266742/", "name": "Laurie McLain at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-10-21T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Two nights with Steppin' in It's fast-rising lead vocalist", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1668844700041158/", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 1"}, {"date": "2016-10-22T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 2", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/215744518775574/"}, {"date": "2016-10-23T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Michigan's bluegrass and Americana success story", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1696673723915750/", "name": "Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys"}, {"date": "2016-10-25T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Tue.

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/619658961515550/", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "http://www.donhenry.com/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513216465641630/", "name": "Don Henry at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-12-02T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Don White & Christine Lavin at Green Wood Coffee House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1694208660853014/"}, {"date": "2016-12-04T19:30:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "\"Music that challenges and heals\"\u2014The Third Way", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1702249903360615/", "name": "Carrie Newcomer"}, {"date": "2016-12-09T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Chuck Mitchell started singing in Detroit folk clubs in the 1960s.
