Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts. Each week a different area restaurant is on-site selling a Sonic Lunch for concert-goers to purchase. Other restaurants offer special discounts for concert-goers to pick up to take to the park.\n\nSonic Lunch concerts are free and suitable for all ages. Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers.

Not your typical sports memoir, Chasing Water also contains arresting black-and-white drawings and a graphic story extra, as well as an inventive and mercurial narrative style that morphs chapter by chapter to reflect Ervin\u2019s restless, multifaceted life. Ervin won a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games at the age of nineteen. He is an athlete branded with a slew of titles including being the first US Olympic swimmer of African American descent, along with Jewish heritage, who also grew up with Tourette\u2019s syndrome. He shocked the sporting world by retiring soon after claiming two world titles following the 2000 Olympics. Auctioning off his gold medal for charity, he set off on a part spiritual quest, part self-destructive bender that involved Zen temples, fast motorcycles, tattoo parlors, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands. Then Ervin resurfaced in 2012 to not only make the US Olympic team twelve years after his first appearance, but to continue his career by swimming faster than ever before, and faster than anyone else. \n\n\"Here Ervin and swim trainer and journalist Markides combine talents to create a biography that is part first-hand narrative by Ervin, with Markides filling in the details and providing context. The formula works, pulling readers into Ervin's experience of the thrill of victory and search for meaning....Featuring more depth, breadth, truth, and the effects of reckless choices than found in traditional athlete biographies, this gripping account is just in time for the gear up to the Rio 2016 Olympics. Readers will understand the psyche and life of elite athletes as never before, then cheer Ervin on in his attempt to make another Olympic team.\"--Library Journal\n\n\"A celebrated Olympian recounts how he rose to the top of his sport, crashed, and found redemption....This book, which tells his story through a narrative that interweaves the former gold medalist's memories with commentary by his friend and colleague Markides, reveals the extreme highs and lows that characterized Ervin's remarkable life and career....The author never flinches at revealing his less-than-perfect past, and the humility he demonstrates at coming to terms with his own egotism and personal shortcomings makes the book frequently compelling. A provocative and refreshingly honest redemption memoir.\"--Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"Markides smartly combines his own journalistic account with a parallel narrative in which Ervin...explains his life and style. Some talents simply defy explanation, however, and Ervin may be in that category....The story of his comeback at 31 (ancient for a swimmer) is rendered more amazing by the contrast with what went before.\"--Booklist \n\n\"Most memoirs from Olympians are puff pieces, ghost-written so blandly you fall asleep trying to make it to the end of the first chapter.

For two months he danced, filmed, made music, did standup comedy, wrote and much more, untill he found out what he loved doing most: making music. He uploaded a couple of tracks on Youtube and Soundcloud, and Bakermat was born. Since then he stepped in a rollercoaster ride he could have never imagined. First official single \u2018Vandaag (One Day)\u2019 became a huge hit all over Europe hitting top 10 spots in almost every country. The early succes got rewarded with platinum records in France, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. The succes was largely attributed to the fact that he came with an entirely different and new sound, combining minimal and deep house with jazz and soul. It laid a foundation for the genres we now know as \u2018tropical house\u2019 or \u2018melodic house\u2019, in which he is still seen as the founder and pioneer. He keeps trying to bring new and refreshing music out, always trying to be as unique and renewing as possible. A huge succes was his record released in 2015 \u201cTeach Me\u201d where he mixedSoul, Gospel and Disco to a record that set a new standard in the \u2018melodic house\u2019 genre. \n\nBakermat also became well know because of his innovative performances and stage hostings. He did shows in Paris, London and other big cities with an entire band called \u2018The Bakermat Live Band\u2019. In Paris he even played in the legendary L\u2019Olympia with his band, a sold out show. He played at almost every big festival there is over the last 3 years like I Love Techno, Ultra Miami, Sensation White, Mainsquare, Montreux Jazz Festival, Tomorrowland, Mysteryland, South West Four and the list goes on and on. He is also the host of stages at the biggest festivals like the \u2018Bakermat & Friends\u2019 stage at Tomorrowland every year, or the \u201cBakermat\u2019s Gospel Church\u2019 at Kingsday Festival and a lot more. As one of the founders his goal is to bring new talent or fellow colleagues to the stage and that's exactly what he does when he's curating a stage. Artists like Klingande, Thomas Jack, The Avener, Robin Schulz and Oliver Heldens are often guests at one of his stages. Bakermat\u2019s new album \u2018Bon Voyage\u2019 is his first studio album and will be released in 2015, it contains a lot of new material and new styles/ production techniques, because according to Bakermat this was an opportunity for him to \u201c really be free of restrictions and make exactly what I want\u201d. With his album, remixes, releases and confirmed shows at the biggest festivals lined up, it seems 2016 will be a great year for Bakermat once again.\n\n\nWho is Sam Feldt?\n\nDeemed a \"Modern House superstar\" by Billboard, Sam Feldt broke onto the scene in 2013 with remixes including \"On Trees and Birds and Fire\" from I Am Oak. In 2015, he released a remake of \"Show Me Love\" from Robin S. which charted highly across the world. \n\nThe Dutch DJ, born August 1, 1993, is currently signed to Spinnin' Records and most recently released \"Summer On You\", a melodic and deep tropical track with Lucas & Steve featuring Wulf.\n\nwww.PrimeSocial.com\n===============================\nGET INVOLVED: Want to get involved with PSG?

The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it.

It instantly went top 10 viral on Spotify and received regular radio airplay. NPR music called 'Delilah' an \"eclectic, fully formed debut album.\" Daytrotter wrote, \"It's one of those 10-song records that's damned near perfect, traveling through the old, smoky bars of older days and down the twisted back roads of love.\" On July 15th, 2015 East made his television debut on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" and also appeared on \"CBS This Morning Saturday\" in support of his album.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/724", "name": "Anderson East - Devil in Me Tour 9/27/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-09-27T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1731098520471774/", "description": "We're bringing the Painting With Dreams tour to Necto Nightclub in Ann Arbor!\n\nNew album, a brand new stage production, and most important, all of our Tritonians of Michigan under one roof!!!!\n\nMore info and tickets - http://paintingwithdreams.com/\n\nSee you this fall!", "name": "Tritonal: Painting With Dreams - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-09-28T14:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/517141991807074/", "description": "Jeremy Horn grew up in Memphis -- \"Home of the Blues\" and \"Birthplace of Rock and Roll\" -- but his music sounds more like the Beatles than B.B. King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is No Other Love. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/749295545208940/", "description": "Join us for Intuitives Interactive's 4th Annual FALL HOLISTIC & PSYCHIC EXPO!

October 27 | 8pm | All Ages | $25 Cover\n\nann arbor's 107one Presents:\nBrett Dennen wsg: Lily & Madeleine\n\nAs common and simple as it is, \"por favor\" is such an evocative expression. From Spanish, it translates to \"please,\" a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. \"Por favor' was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,\" says Brett Dennen. \"We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.\"\n\n\"When you say please, you're asking something to come into your life,\" Dennen adds. \"It might mean that you're weak and need something to make you strong. But you're admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.\"\n\nThat notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen's intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.\n\n\"All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn't feeling confident about myself,\" he says. \"When I'm not feeling confident, I'm not a nice person to be around. I don't take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I'm in that place.\"\n\nA followup to 2013's Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It's the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it's by no means a sad affair, nor is it the \"rainyday record\" Dennen initially thought he was making.\n\nOften framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. \"And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let's go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,\" he sings over a chugging groove on \"Bonfire.\"\n\nOn \"Where We Left Off,\" the album's emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: \"Everyone knows I'm a happy man/ But I haven't been right.\"\n\n\"Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,\" Dennen admits. \"Is there something I'm scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren't in that zone.\"\n\n\"I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,\" he continues. \"I don't have to worry about whether they'll be on the radio or if they're different from my previous stuff.\"\n\nHoled up at Cobb's Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb's insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. \"We recorded it the way people made records in the '60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,\" he says. \"We didn't do anything more than five times. We didn't secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It's not sloppy, but it's in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.\"\n\nCobb adds, \"I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He's very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.\"\n\nMore than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. \"My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,\" he says.\n\nThat marked a detour from his most recent releases. With those he felt like he was exercising his craftsmanship - \"being a songwriter for the sake of being a songwriter,\" as he puts it. \"I really wanted this new album to come across as a whole piece,\" Dennen says. \"I consider it to be a batch of songs that all live together and complement each other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the album title. Please.\n\n\"What was I asking for with this album\" Dennen says. \"I wanted to be a good person and feel good about myself again, but in a way that I knew it was OK to be sad. That's part of life, the ups and downs. But with these songs, I want to make people feel good about themselves and about life through the good and bad.\"\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/718", "name": "Brett Dennen w/ Lily and Madeleine 10/27/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-10-27T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/147078752335941/", "description": "There is no better storyteller than Chuck Brodsky.

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\n\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\n\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\n\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal.

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA.

Ad\u00e9 formed his first band in 1967 and has been in the limelight in Nigeria ever since. Singing in his native Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 language, Ad\u00e9 went on to define the terms \u201cAfropop\u201d and \u201cWorld Beat\u201d and to open the door to the West for other African musicians. King Sunny Ad\u00e9 & His African Beats last toured North America in 2005.
