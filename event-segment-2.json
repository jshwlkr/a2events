This event is being held in conjunction with the UMS presentation of the Tak\u00e1cs Quartet on October 8 and 9, at Rackham Auditorium. For more information or to purchase tickets, please visit ums.org.\n\n'They are not for you but for a later age!' -Ludwig van Beethoven, on the Opus 59 quartets\n\nBeethoven's sixteen string quartets are some of the most extraordinary and challenging pieces of music ever written. They have inspired artists of all kinds - not only musicians - and have been subject to endless reinterpretation. What does it feel like to be a musician taking on these iconic works? And how do the four string players who make up a quartet interact, both musically and personally?\n\nThe Tak\u00e1cs is one of the world's pre-eminent string quartets. Performances of Beethoven have shaped their work together for over forty years. Using the history of both the Tak\u00e1cs Quartet and the Beethoven quartets as the backbone to his story, Edward Dusinberre, first violinist of the Tak\u00e1cs since 1993, recounts the exhilarating challenge of tackling these pieces. Beethoven for a Later Age takes the reader inside the daily life of a quartet, vividly showing the necessary creative tension between individual and group expression and how four people can enjoy making music together over a long period of time.\n\nThe key, the author argues, is in balancing continuity with change and experimentation - a theme that lies at the heart of Beethoven's remarkable compositions. No other composer has posed so many questions about the form and emotional content of a string quartet, and come up with so many different answers. In an accessible style, suitable for novices and chamber music enthusiasts alike, Dusinberre illuminates the variety and inherent contradictions of Beethoven's quartets, composed against the turbulent backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars and their aftermath, and shows that engaging with this radical music continues to be as invigorating now as it was for its first performers and audiences.\n\nEdward Dusinberre was born in 1968 in Leamington Spa, England, and has enjoyed playing the violin from a young age. His early experiences as concertmaster of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain encouraged him to choose music as a profession. He studied with the Ukrainian violinist Felix Andrievsky at the Royal College of Music in London and at the Juilliard School with Dorothy DeLay and Piotr Milewski. In 1990 he won the British Violin Recital Prize and gave his debut recital in London at the Purcell Room, South Bank Centre. Upon completion of his studies at Juilliard Dusinberre auditioned for the Tak\u00e1cs Quartet, which he joined in 1993 as first violin.\n\nSteven Whiting, a native of Chicago, graduated from Macalester College in 1975 with a major in music (voice, piano) and a minor in German.He studied musicology at Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet in Kiel, Germany, on a Fulbright grant (1975\u201377) and sang for a season with the Chicago Symphony Chorus before pursuing graduate work at the University of Illinois. There he took an M.M. in Musicology with a thesis on \u201cErik Satie and Parisian Musical Entertainment,\u201d and his Ph.D. with a dissertation on Beethoven\u2019s early variations (\u201cTo the \u2018New Manner\u2019 Born\u201d). Between degrees, he spent four years as a desk editor at A-R Editions of Madison, Wisconsin, sang with several early music groups, and performed in contemporary music ensembles. After teaching for two years at the University of Illinois, he came to the University of Michigan in 1991 as a visiting assistant professor.", "name": "Edward Dusinberre with Steven Whiting", "date": "2016-10-06T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1646167612272291/", "description": "Author: \n\nLaurie Halse Anderson is a New York Times bestselling author known for tackling tough subjects with humor and sensitivity.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/325333901135326/", "description": "Maize & Blue Velvet: a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation\nTicket proceeds to benefit the Chicago division of the David Lynch Foundation and the Ann Arbor Film Festival\n\nwith special guests\n\nWindy & Carl\n\nWolf Eyes\n\nAaron Dilloway\n\nDJ stylings by Dykehouse (Ghostly International)\n\nAbout the Foundation\nThe David Lynch Foundation\u2019s core mission is to heal traumatic stress and raise performance in at risk populations, including veterans suffering from PTSD and mothers and their families who have lost loved ones to violence.

Ford School of Public Policy\u2019s LGBTQ+ student organization, presents \u201cCome Out to the Races!\u201d Ann Arbor\u2019s first Drag Queen Race. Co-sponsored by the Jim Toy Community Center (JTCC), the race will be held on National Coming Out Day (NCOD), October 11, 2016 at the University of Michigan\u2019s Diag from 6:00pm to 8:30pm. Founded in 1988, NCOD is an annual LGBTQ awareness day premised on the idea that the act of \u201ccoming out,\u201d or the voluntary self-disclosure of one\u2019s sexuality or gender identity is an act of both personal and political activism. The experience of disclosure contributes to eliminating homophobia by promoting openness and understanding over silence and ignorance. In other words, communities are more likely to support LGBTQ-empowering laws if they know someone who identifies as LGBTQ. \n\nThe NCOD event is inspired by the 17th Street High Heel Drag Race, an annual costumed race in Washington, DC that has attracted over 100,000 spectators for the last 26 years. Drag, as a form of expression wherein a person dresses and acts with exaggerated feminine features, is widely considered to be one of the most visible representations of queer culture. \n\nELIGIBILITY - The event is free and open to the public. Participation in the event as an individual dressed in drag is contingent on the completion of an application and a signed waiver form. Persons who dress in drag are not required to participate in the race. The race, however, will be open only to those who dress in drag. Everyone is welcome to join us as avid and supportive spectators!\n\n6:00pm - Pre-Race Events. Two hours prior to the race, those who dressed in drag have the opportunity to parade around in the Diag and showcase their outfits. In addition to the parade, campus and community groups will be tabling in the Diag, so that students and community members can be informed about the litany of organizations that support LGBTQ+ rights. \n\n7:30pm - Grand Marshal\u2019s Remarks. Mr. Jim Toy, Founder of the JTCC will be our Grand Marshal. He will provide brief opening remarks in the Diag on why the act of coming out is important and still matters. Then, he will escort the racers to the starting line and will hand over the mic to the emcee prior to the start of the race. \n\n8:00pm \u2013 Drag Queen Race. The emcee will start the race by blowing a horn to signal the start. The top three winners will each receive a medal to commemorate their victory. \n\n8:30pm \u2013 Post-Race Social. While the venue is yet to be determined, there will be a social event after the race at a bar in Ann Arbor.\n\nFor inspiration on the drag queen race, check out these photos:\n\n2013 DC High Heel Race (http://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/photos-high-heel-race-2013)\n\n2014 DC High Heel Race (http://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/photos-high-heel-race-on-17th-street-2014)\n\n2015 DC High Heel Race (http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/10/29/photos-high-heel-race/)", "name": "Come Out to the Races!

Alexander will be joined in conversation by Natalie Bakopoulos, author of The Green Shore.\n\nSet in the Pacific Northwest in the jittery, jacked-up early 1990s, Shelter in Place, by one of America\u2019s most thrillingly defiant contemporary authors, is a stylish literary novel about the hereditary nature of mental illness, the fleeting intensity of youth, the obligations of family, and the dramatic consequences of love.\n\nJoseph March, a twenty-one-year-old working class kid from Seattle, has just graduated from college and his future beckons, unencumbered, limitless, magnificent. Joe\u2019s life implodes when he starts to suffer the symptoms of bipolar disorder, and, not long after, his mother, Anne-Marie March, beats a stranger to death with a hammer.\n\nJoe moves to White Pine, Washington, where Anne-Marie is serving time and his father has set up house. He is followed by Tess Wolff, a fiercely independent woman with whom he is in love. Meanwhile, Joe\u2019s mother is gradually being transformed into a national heroine. Many see her crime as a furious, exasperated act of righteous rebellion. Tess, too, is under her spell. Spurred on by Anne-Marie\u2019s example, she enlists Joe in a secret, violent plan that will forever change their lives.\n\nMaksik sings of modern America\u2019s battered soul and of the lacerating emotions that make us human. Magnetic and masterfully told, Shelter in Place is about the things we are willing to die for, and those we\u2019re willing to kill for.\n\n\"Alexander Maksik\u2019s riveting and disturbing novel Shelter in Place is a totally original exploration of mental illness, sexual politics, family and violence.\" --The Guardian. \n\n\"Alexander Maksik covers fresh ground with each new work. In poetic bursts\u2026he captures [his characters\u2019] inner convulsions while exploring the passions that can drive, and destroy, us.\"--Vanity Fair\n\nAlexander Maksik is the author of three novels: You Deserve Nothing; A Marker to Measure Drift, which was named a New York Times Notable Book and a finalist for both the William Saroyan Prize and Le Prix du Meilleur Livre \u00c9tranger; and the forthcoming Shelter in Place, due out in September.

Maksik is the recipient of a 2015 Pushcart Prize, as well as fellowships from the Truman Capote Literary Trust and The Corporation of Yaddo.

I have never met Jordan Zandi, but I would like to, for there is a sweet spirit haunting his guileless poems. His inner world is always interacting with the outer world, and as a result everything seems to be shining. 'Walking across the binary field, / what does the young man see?' Zandi asks, searching for signs with his subtle eyes. The answer seems to be the great opium of simply being content within oneself\u2014with a heart that receives and watches (if a heart watches), while resisting the systems that hurt us\u2014and remaining awake to experience.\"\u2014Henri Cole, from the Foreword  \n\nJordan Zandi is the author of Solarium (Sarabande Books), which was chosen by Henri Cole as the winner of the Kathryn A.

Ryan Packard is known mostly for his extensive work as a composer and percussionist within the thriving contemporary classical scene in Chicago, while Albert Wildeman has achieved fame for his meteoric rise from novice instrumentalist to one of the busiest players in town after relocating to Chicago from the Netherlands in 2011 to immerse himself in the city\u2019s broad-shouldered music world.

They play original and traditional music in a variety of forms \u2013 original musical settings of a broad array of poetry, original instrumental pieces, and traditional Irish tunes and songs. This unique collaboration brings out qualities in both of these seasoned musicians that you may not have heard from them before.  Their music is rendered with lush beauty, sensitivity and humor on an unusual array of strings  -- various guitars in varied tunings, mandola, mandolin, bouzouki, cittern, tenor guitar -- and their blended voices.\n\n They take the name Noctambule, French for 'night-owl,\u2019 from a Robert Service poem about a nocturnal ramble through the back alleys of Paris, which they have set to music and included on their acclaimed CD Travel in the Shadows.  Their first CD together, it explores many forms of the \u2018night journey\u2019 in song, offering the traveler the opportunity to see and experience things differently once the usual sources of light have been extinguished.  They have selected a broad variety of \u2018noctambulatory\u2019 verse from Tennyson, Neruda, Roethke, St. Vincent Millay, and Robert Service. In addition, they include two original instrumental pieces \u2013 a reel and a waltz \u2013 as well as one traditional Irish song. \n\n BRUCE VICTOR is an eclectic and accomplished guitarist and composer, who plays several different guitars in several different tunings. Seemingly resisting any single musical genre, he has been labeled a 'poly-stylist\u2019 by one of the editors of Acoustic Guitar magazine. He has played with The Sirens of San Francisco, The Triplicates, and as a solo performer.  He was the founder of The Acoustic Vortex, a non-profit musical organization that produced house concerts, mentored youth performers, and performed benefit concerts for other non-profit organizations.  He is also a practicing psychiatrist and was a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n MARLA FIBISH is well known in the Irish music world, bringing a musicality and excitement to the tradition that is seldom heard on the mandolin.  She is also known for her compositions, musical settings of poetry and instrumental pieces that have been featured in her work with Out of the Rain, and Three Mile Stone, and on her acclaimed instrumental recording with Jimmy Crowley, The Morning Star. In addition to the mandolin, Marla brings mandola, tenor guitar, bouzouki, accordion, and her alto voice to the Noctambule sound.\n\nPack something warm, and come prepared for adventure ....\n\nVisit Noctambule on the web at http://www.noctambulemusic.com/", "name": "Noctambule - In Concert", "date": "2016-10-16T17:30:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1754471844769507/", "description": "Our annual awards event, the Civvies, is coming up!

Brit will be joined in conversation by Chris McCormick, the author of Desert Boys.\n\nSet within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett\u2019s mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret. \u201cAll good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we\u2019d taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.\u201d\n\nIt is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother\u2019s recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor\u2019s son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it\u2019s not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance\u2014and the subsequent cover-up\u2014will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt.\n\nIn entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a \u201cwhat if\u201d can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.\n\n\u201cBrit Bennett\u2019s masterful debut is brimming with unforgettable scenes and the sort of keenly-observed, precise language that makes you look at your own relationships anew. Told with the wisdom of a seasoned, compassionate storyteller, The Mothers is a novel about community, friendship, grief and growth. The two women at the center of this novel are characters you will find yourself thinking about long after you\u2019ve turned the last page\u2013 they pull you in close and never let you go. Bennett is a brilliant and much-needed new voice in literature.\u201d \u2013Angela Flournoy, author of National Book Award-finalist The Turner House\n\n\u201cBrit Bennett\u2019s The Mothers is an engaging and assured debut novel of depth, and introspective power. It succeeds as a brilliant study of a modern black woman, and as a lyrical and majestic portrait of her place in society.\u201d \u2014Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen\n\n\u201cWonderful \u2013 warm and tender and necessary.\u201d \u2013Yaa Gyasi, author of Homegoing \n\nBorn and raised in Southern California, Brit Bennett graduated from Stanford University and later earned her MFA in fiction at the University of Michigan, where she won a Hopwood Award in Graduate Short Fiction as well as the 2014 Hurston/Wright Award for College Writers.

Bassist and producer Kevin Pritchard, recently thawed from an extremely rare prehistoric groove glacier, discovered the forlorn Hertler in a twinkling, mysteriously fortuitous place called The Quilted Attic. Alongside legendary glacier-hunter Rick Hale-who would later spend decades forging a drum set from pure, white-hot, ancient stardust to mark the occasion-Pritchard changed the world: He wrangled Hertler into musical collaboration.

Ms. Butter has spent nearly 30 years inspiring countless children to find the courage to take compassionate action and transcend obstacles. The film depicts Ms. Butter\u2019s poignant connection to Anne Frank, her own childhood experiences in two concentration camps, and her choice to adopt an empowered view of her history, leading to a life of openheartedness, joy, and activism.\rThe screening will be followed by a talk back with film director, Evelyn Neuhaus, and Irene Butter.\r\n\nIrene Butter was born in Berlin, Germany and grew up Jewish in Nazi-occupied Europe. A survivor of two concentration camps, she came to the U.S. in 1945. After graduating from Queens College in New York, she earned a PhD in economics from Duke University and taught at the University of Michigan for over 35 years. Since 1987, she has been visiting schools to teach students about the Holocaust and the lessons she learned during those traumatic years. She co-founded the Wallenberg lecture series honoring global change- makers and the Arab-Jewish women\u2019s dialog group, Zeitouna. Butter resides with her husband in Ann Arbor.\n\n\rEvelyn Neuhaus is a first-time filmmaker. She knew Irene Butter, the subject of Never a Bystander, for decades before learning that Butter was a Holocaust survivor and hearing her story. In 2007, Neuhaus was an assistant producer for Refusing to Be Enemies: The Zeitouna Story, about an Arab-Jewish women\u2019s dialogue group Butter co-founded. She holds an MPH and an MBA from the University of Michigan and resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She is currently exploring topics for her next film.\n\n\rFor more information about Never a Bystander and this extraordinary story of compassion,\r \rforgiveness, and empowered action, visit www.neverabystander.com\rThis program is co-sponsored by the Michigan Community Scholars Program and the\rUniversity of Michigan Museum of Art", "name": "Film Screening: Never a Bystander", "date": "2016-10-26T18:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/284974851895383/", "description": "Two nights of dark delights!\n\nWednesday October 19, and Wednesday, October 26!\n\nThis annual event will be one of your favorite events this fall!

October 27 | 8pm | All Ages | $25 Cover\n\nann arbor's 107one Presents:\nBrett Dennen wsg: Lily & Madeleine\n\nAs common and simple as it is, \"por favor\" is such an evocative expression. From Spanish, it translates to \"please,\" a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. \"Por favor' was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,\" says Brett Dennen. \"We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.\"\n\n\"When you say please, you're asking something to come into your life,\" Dennen adds. \"It might mean that you're weak and need something to make you strong. But you're admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.\"\n\nThat notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen's intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.\n\n\"All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn't feeling confident about myself,\" he says. \"When I'm not feeling confident, I'm not a nice person to be around. I don't take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I'm in that place.\"\n\nA followup to 2013's Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It's the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it's by no means a sad affair, nor is it the \"rainyday record\" Dennen initially thought he was making.\n\nOften framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. \"And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let's go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,\" he sings over a chugging groove on \"Bonfire.\"\n\nOn \"Where We Left Off,\" the album's emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: \"Everyone knows I'm a happy man/ But I haven't been right.\"\n\n\"Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,\" Dennen admits. \"Is there something I'm scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren't in that zone.\"\n\n\"I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,\" he continues. \"I don't have to worry about whether they'll be on the radio or if they're different from my previous stuff.\"\n\nHoled up at Cobb's Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb's insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. \"We recorded it the way people made records in the '60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,\" he says. \"We didn't do anything more than five times. We didn't secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It's not sloppy, but it's in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.\"\n\nCobb adds, \"I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He's very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.\"\n\nMore than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. \"My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,\" he says.\n\nThat marked a detour from his most recent releases. With those he felt like he was exercising his craftsmanship - \"being a songwriter for the sake of being a songwriter,\" as he puts it. \"I really wanted this new album to come across as a whole piece,\" Dennen says. \"I consider it to be a batch of songs that all live together and complement each other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the album title. Please.\n\n\"What was I asking for with this album\" Dennen says. \"I wanted to be a good person and feel good about myself again, but in a way that I knew it was OK to be sad. That's part of life, the ups and downs. But with these songs, I want to make people feel good about themselves and about life through the good and bad.\"\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/718", "name": "Brett Dennen w/ Lily and Madeleine 10/27/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-10-27T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1768483113364835/", "description": "Come One...

His groove-oriented strumming and fingerpicking draw on influences from the mountains of western North Carolina where he now lives, and from lots of different good old traditional folk stuff of all kinds. Chuck is widely known for his many wonderful songs about the heroes -- and zeroes -- of baseball.

They favored soft-focus images that drew upon the conventions of important artists and movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\u2014the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, James McNeill Whistler,\r Japonisme, and Art Nouveau are readily seen in the images on view in this exhibition.\rIn 1902 Alfred Stieglitz and other Pictorialist photographers founded the Photo-Secession in New York, with Camera Work as the flagship periodical that published images by the group. Their poetic compositions drawn from contemporary life, combined with the use of expensive and labor-intensive printing materials such as platinum and gum bichromate, established these photographs as complex and nuanced works of high artistic quality.

November 10 | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nTucker Beathard  wsg: Aubrie Sellers\n\nTucker Beathard - Growing up in a family that excelled at both music and sports \u2014 his father is a hit songwriter; his brothers, star quarterbacks \u2014 Big Machine Label Group recording artist Tucker Beathard has an unrelenting competitive spirit: He wakes up every day trying to write the perfect song. For Tucker, a self-taught guitarist and drummer, there's no such thing as \"good enough.\"   \"I love anything with great melodies and I'm drawn to the little things,\" Tucker says, rattling off his influences with an artist's attention to detail. \"When I listen to Led Zeppelin, I focus on John Bonham's drums. Or Joe Walsh's guitar licks in the Eagles. And Hank Williams Jr.'s 'Family Tradition' is as country songwriting as it gets.\"  Tucker certainly knows something about family tradition, taking cues from dad Casey Beathard, who wrote Kenny Chesney's \"Don't Blink\" and Eric Church's \"Homeboy.\" The latter, in fact, was inspired by Tucker, who admits to going through his own rebellious phase.  Giving up a college baseball scholarship to dive headlong into songwriting, Tucker came out better for his diverse experiences and documented those wild times in the wise-beyond-its-years \"Momma and Jesus.\" The track is one of many in contention for his debut album, being overseen by producer Angelo Petraglia (Kings Of Leon).   With a rhythmic way of playing guitar, influenced by his innate drumming ability, Tucker has created some of contemporary country music's most progressive songs. \"Rock On,\" a song about regretting the girl that got away, is taut in its delivery, with clever turns of phrase. Likewise, \"20-10 Tennessee,\" a standout, uses a football game as metaphor for a relationship and \u201cBetter Than Me\u201d puts a unique spin on an arena-ready breakup anthem, ultimately wishing the best for someone after parting ways.   \"I've always been a huge fan of deep songs, and I've always liked poems,\" he says. \"I'm an introvert, but writing songs that go beneath the surface allows me the chance to open up a piece of myself.\"   As does his engaging live show.  Having played with artists like Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert, Tucker regularly bares his soul in front of a crowd. Despite his reserved demeanor, the stage is where he is most free \u2014 it's his canvas to paint an honest picture of who he is, as both a songwriter and an artist.   \"Expressing yourself onstage and putting your emotion into each song is a feeling that is tough to match. It's your way of letting the world know who you are,\" says Tucker, who has one main goal when performing. \"Whether it's 'My heart is broken' or 'Let's party tonight,' I want people to feel this is a real dude who knows who he is \u2014 and who says it like it is.\"", "name": "Tucker Beathard 11/10/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-11-10T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/243866962676949/", "description": "Fri.

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\n\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\n\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\n\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal.

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-11-17T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513216465641630/", "description": "Grammy Award winner Don Henry's songs have been recorded by legends such as Ray Charles, Patti Page and Conway Twitty; by country crooners including Gene Watson, John Conlee and B.J.

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound.

With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory.

In Toronto, on his first out of town gig, he met Canadian songwriter Joni Anderson. They married, and as a duo Chuck and Joni Mitchell played the coffeehouse circuit, and gin rummy, until they divorced in 1968. Mitchell's credits include A Prairie Home Companion and repertory theatre in Texas and in England. He has played Harold Hill in The Music Man and Woody Guthrie in Woody Guthrie's American Song. Most recently, he wrote and produced Mr. Foster & Mr. Twain, in which Stephen Foster joins Mark Twain for an evening of story and song. A Chuck Mitchell's show combines his seasoned skills as an actor, singer and guitarist with a selection of delightful material. He sings cabaret songs by Brecht and Weil -- \"Mack the Knife\" and \"The Bilbao Song\" -- and whimsical songs by Flanders & Swann -- \"The Gnu\" and \"Have Some Madeira, M'dear\". He roves the room singing \"Freeborn Man\" by Ewan McColl, or \"Necessity\" from Finian's Rainbow. He weaves poetry by Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot into his shows.

While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "name": "Dopapod & Pigeons Playing Ping Pong at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-12-14T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/253901491631138/", "description": "Katie Geddes sings traditional and contemporary folk, country-folk, and folk-pop tunes.
