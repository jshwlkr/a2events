Katie will be joined in conversation by Natalie Bakopoulos, author of The Green Shore.\n\nA young woman has agreed with her faithless husband: it\u2019s time for them to separate. For the moment it\u2019s a private matter, a secret between the two of them. As she begins her new life, she gets word that Christopher has gone missing in a remote region in the rugged south of Greece; she reluctantly agrees to go look for him, still keeping their split to herself. In her heart, she\u2019s not even sure if she wants to find him. As her search comes to a shocking breaking point, she discovers she understands less than she thought she did about her relationship and the man she used to love. \n\nA searing, suspenseful story of intimacy and infidelity, A Separation lays bare the gult that divides us from the inner lives of others. With exquisitely cool precision, Katie Kitamura propels us into the experience of a woman on edge, with a fiercely mesmerizing story to tell.\n\n\u201cA slow burn of a novel that gathers its great force and intensity through careful observation and a refusal to accept old, shopworn narratives of love and loss.\u201d \u2014Jenny Offill, author of Dept. of Speculation\n\n\u201cA novel so seamless, that follows its path with such consequence, that even minor deviations seem loaded with meaning. Wonderful.\u201d \u2014Karl Ove Knausgaard, author of My Struggle\n\n\u201cThe burnt landscape, the disappearance of a man, the brilliantly cold, precise, and yet threatening, churning tone of the narrator\u2014make A Separation an absolutely mesmerizing work of art.\u201d \u2014Rachel Kushner, author of The Flamethrowers\n\n\u201cProfound and gripping. I had that rare sense of feeling like I was in a creation specifically made out of words, that couldn\u2019t have been made out of any other substance. Kitamura combines the calm complexity of Joseph Conrad with the pacing and reveal of Patricia Highsmith. This novel is a wonder and a pleasure.\u201d \u2014Rivka Galchen, author of Atmospheric Disturbances and Little Labors\n\n\u201cA Separation opens up fissures of ambiguity in emotional experiences too often misunderstood as monolithic\u2014grief, desire, estrangement\u2014and plumbs these crevices for all their complexities. It has both urgency and afterglow: I read it quickly, but didn\u2019t stop thinking about it for a long time once I was done.\u201d \u2014Leslie Jamison, author of The Empathy Exams\n\nKatie Kitamura is a critic and novelist living in New York City. She is the author of Gone to the Forest and The Longshot, both of which were finalists for the New York Public Library\u2019s Young Lions Fiction Award. A recipient of a Lannan Residency Fellowship, Kitamura has written for The New York Times, The Guardian, Granta, BOMB, Triple Canopy, and is a regular contributor to Frieze.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, February 13, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Teenage Linda lives with her parents in the austere woods of northern Minnesota, where their nearly abandoned commune stands as a last vestige of a lost counter-culture world. Isolated at home and an outsider at school, Linda is drawn to the enigmatic, attractive Lily and new history teacher Mr. Grierson. When Mr. Grierson is faced with child pornography charges, his arrest deeply affects Linda as she wrestles with her own fledgling desires and craving to belong.\n\nAnd then the young Gardner family moves in across the lake and Linda finds herself welcomed into their home as a babysitter for their little boy, Paul. But with this new sense of belonging come expectations and secrets she doesn\u2019t understand. Over the course of a summer, Linda makes a set of choices that reverberate throughout her life. As she struggles to find a way out of the sequestered world into which she was born, Linda confronts the life-and-death consequences of the things people do\u2014and fail to do\u2014for the people they love.\n\nWinner of the McGinnis-Ritchie award for its first chapter, and A BEA Buzz Book and An ABA Indies Introduce Selection, Emily Fridlund\u2019s agonizing and gorgeously written History of Wolves introduces a new writer of enormous range and talent.\n\n\u201c\u2018Winter collapsed on us that year.

Humanity, happiness, and the survival of the biosphere spin each section forward, species are wiped out, yet the poem endures. \n\n\u201cIn Make Yourself Happy, Eleni Sikelianos evinces a neuro-psychological state counter to the miswrought biology that has haunted the Occident since the dawn of Roman times. These poems open the neurology to its whole participation in the psycho-physical field and are not unlike the seminal amplification of indigenous culture, where the language of the body simultaneously circulates with living metastates. These poems organically form as environmental respiration that only the poet can approach in the latter days of this techno-hypercritical epoch.\u201d \u2014Will Alexander\n\n\u201cThis poem is addressed to you. You want to be happy, don\u2019t you? In deceptively simple sentences, it tells you how to \u2018make yourself happy.\u2019 You might aspirate on honey, for instance. Play connect the dots and the extinct animals pop out. Did you kill them all to make yourself happy? Here you will bask in the syllabic glow of the \u2018shirred / aggregates / mineral iridium / irresidue.\u2019 This book is your invitation to the post-human pool party of the future.\u201d \u2014Rae Armantrout\n\n\u201cWith her native Greek wisdom and her American exuberance, Eleni takes us into the different layers which make our daily lives, perceptions, thoughts . . . as they take form, and thanks to her become an initiatique, even archeological, journey. Besides the pleasure we feel, we see here a moral endeavor, an invitation to make ourselves happy. Her journey finds its energy in her perfect ear for language and immense generosity of heart. Her openness lets in the sinuosities and cracks of what we may well end up calling \u2018being,\u2019 in her great project of telling us, in these worst moments of actual history, to be (urgently) happy because we are . . . happy. And let me share at least one epiphany: \u2018to graze in / winter in snow- / free meadows.\u2019\u201d \u2014Etel Adnan\n\nEleni Sikelianos is the author of six books of poetry, most recently The Loving Detail of the Living and the Dead and The California Poem, which was a Barnes & Noble Best of the Year, as well as hybrid memoirs, The Book of Jon and You Animal Machine (The Golden Greek).

By inclination a voracious reader and by profession a librarian, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha . When she didn\u2019t find one that satisfied her, she had the notion to write her own based on the spiritual struggles of women in the Buddha\u2019s time, set in the fascinating world that gave birth to yoga and Buddhism. Steeped in India\u2019s myths and legends, this novel is fresh territory for Western readers of fantasy and historical epics. Through its strong female characters, it will appeal to readers of historical fiction with a woman\u2019s perspective. Light refreshments. Signing to follow.\n\nMore about the book:\nA beautiful warrior princess. A tormented prince. A terrible choice between love, duty, and spiritual freedom.\n\nRebellious Dhara runs away from her Himalayan clan to study with the powerful yogi Mala, a mysterious woman with a violent past. Flung by war onto an adventure-filled journey, Dhara meets and captures the heart of Siddhartha, whose skill in the martial arts and extraordinary mental powers equal her own.\n \nWorldly power and pleasure seduce Dhara, creating a chasm between her and her husband, who longs to follow a sage\u2019s solitary path. She takes on the warrior\u2019s role Siddhartha does not want, and when she returns wounded from battle court intrigue drives them further apart.

In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.  www.tomchapin.com", "name": "Tom Chapin at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2017-03-04T16:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1835138196759120/", "description": "Combining parlor games with the classic social lubricant (alcohol) to multiply their ice busting powers.\n\nWe will supply some low-key interactive games and craft beer. \nBring your friends or make some new ones. \nSaturdays at 4pm.\nPointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "name": "Icebreakers^2"}, {"date": "2017-03-04T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1204202942946225/", "description": "\u201cThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis is so far from the usual big-band clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d (Dallas)\n\nSince 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble.

The continuous march of sun ups, sun downs, transformations of form, seductions, cape fittings & exsanguinations. Eventually it all just becomes an endless, tired routine. It all seems so exciting & so sexy to those of us who operate knowing we have limited time. But ask any vampire about the downside of eternal life, & you won't be surprised to hear tales of binge eating garlic bread just to feel the hurt, or of the occasional dangling of a wooden stake just over the center of the rib cage. Electric Six knows all about eternal life. Electric Six has been around forever & it can never die. That's lovely, but it's also very tiring. Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres is the new release by Electric Six on Metropolis Records. One listen & you will immediately understand that the sexiest vampires are urban vampires. Where E6 has dabbled in dance, hip-hop & R&B in the past, Fresh Blood is the whole enchilada. It's thirteen songs designed to make the listener interested in smooth & nasty fuckin', the way they do it in the city. From the Grandmaster Flash-inspired Number Of The Beast to the super smooth tour of the NYC outer boroughs Mood Is Improving, the listener finds himself immediately deposited into an urban drop zone with hustlas & dickblockas coming from behind every corner. The radio-ready pop hits I'll Be In Touch & Dance With Dark Forces are the tracks that get the listener off the street & into the club. & it would not be an Electric Six album without an epic closer, that being the beautiful & haunting Spacewalkin', the ballad that assures the listener that the vampire has now fed & will live a thousand more years, albeit in outer space. Electric Six changes more frequently than change itself, but ultimately this just means they're never gonna put out the same album twice. Fresh Blood for Tired Vampires is poppy & smooth, nasty & raw...& oh so life affirming, especially if you are undead", "name": "Electric 6 - 3/17/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2017-03-18T09:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/238729963252164/", "description": "Zingerman\u2019s Roadhouse has put together 205 special dinners, and we are excited to provide our first special brunch on March 18, 2017.

Krall's new album celebrates a return to jazz and the Great American Songbook and reunites Diana with Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Tommy LiPuma.\n\nDiana Krall is the only jazz singer to have eight albums debut at the top of the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. To date, her albums have garnered five Grammy\u00ae Awards, eight Juno\u00ae Awards and have also earned nine gold, three platinum, and seven multi-platinum albums. Krall\u2019s unique artistry transcends any single musical style and has made her one of the most recognizable artists of our time. \n\nWith a soft contralto and jazz piano chops that have made her a hallmark leader in jazz performance globally, Krall stuns audiences with a jazz sensibility as playful as it is sophisticated. Her phenomenal range as an artist has made her widely popular, innovating jazz and American songbook standards alongside pop explorations. In a rare appearance heightened by the acoustically pristine Hill Auditorium, A2SF is thrilled to open the 34th season of the Ann Arbor Summer Festival Mainstage with this Grammy-winning Canadian artist.\n\nTickets starting at $65\n\nTickets On Sale:\nFebruary 8th at 9 am Festival Donors of $1000+\nFebruary 9th at 9 am Festival Donors of $100+\nFebruary 10th  at 9 am General Public\n\nBy Phone:\t(734) 764-2538\nOnline: \t\tA2SF.org \nIn Person:\tMichigan League Ticket Office, 911 N.

What started off as a proposed March in Washington, DC on June 11th, has quickly morphed into a national movement, as well as a global one. Austin(TX), Portland(ME), Indianapolis(IN), Seattle (WA), Sydney (AU) are just a few of the cities who have announced solidarity marches. And there are MANY others who are in the initial planning stages around our country and the world.\n\nFor those who can not attend the March in DC, we URGE all our community members, their families, friends, and allies to reach out to their local Pride organizations to help coordinate additional solidarity marches. Use these organizations to help bring your local communities together. The issues that face our community are not just national, but local as well. \n\nIn short time, we will start linking all the pop-up solidarity marches to this main event page, as well as a web page that will be created with more information on all the marches.\n\nLet\u2019s make this truly a \u201cNational Pride March\u201d that spreads from coast to coast and shows solidarity through our Pride movement. Although at the pace we are going, we might have to change the name to the \"Global Pride March!\" \n\nFinally...we want to keep building off the mometum and follow the leadership that Black Lives Matter and the Women's March have created in this new era of activism.", "name": "National Pride March"}, {"date": "2017-06-11T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1815304905412687/", "description": "Songs and lore of the Great Lakes", "name": "Neil Woodward"}, {"date": "2017-06-12T00:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1006014226188234/", "description": "Can't make it to Ann Arbor on March 26?
