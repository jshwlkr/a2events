He wrote his first raps at the age of six and hasn't looked back since. Born in Illinois but moved to Arizona in high school, Futuristic's flow seems to be just as hot as his surroundings. His album \"The Rise\" released on May 12th 2015 debuted at #2 on itunes and #9 on Hip-Hop Billboard charts. He has been touring virtually non-stop over the last 2 years headlining his own tours and supporting bigger acts such as Somo & Machine Gun Kelly. His fast witty lyrics mixed with substance and relatable subject matter has gained him a die hard fan base called WTFGang which stands for \"We're The Future\". As an independent artist Futuristic takes pride in his creativity and versatility using his words to inspire his fans and let them know that anything is truly possible but also gives them music to BANG with the top down in the summer. Moving forward he expects to be exactly what he named his lead single from his album.... \"The Greatest\". Futuristic recently was featured on A Great Big World single \"Hold Each Other\" which has led him to National television performances on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, VH1 Streamy Awards, Performing for the Vice President Joe Biden & CEO of Apple Time Cook, for the HRC National Dinner in Washington D.C.\n\nGood music arguably comes from a place that is insightful, meaningful and modern.This is where the living weirdo known as Devvon Terrell lives and sleeps. Hailing from Brooklyn, New York the singer has his own urban style and sound that is a testament to his generation.\n\nDevvon Terrell took the internet by storm, showcasing his talent on various remixes and cover videos on youtube that have gained him as much as 200,000 views on a single video.\n\n \n\nDevvon Terrell wears a variety of hats to translate his music to his audience. From shooting and editing videos to engineering, mixing and mastering all of his music. This jack of all trades mentality has earned him placements with And One Live, C2C Dj Khaled's Halftime Report, a number one Mixtape on Datpiff.com and countless other mediums. Devvon Terrell recently released his first album titled \"Weird Sexy Cool\" and earned a the spot of top 16 albums on the itunes RNB charts. With all his endeavors on the rise Devvon Terrell will surely make the transformation from local talent, to mainstream superstar.", "name": "Futuristic and Devvon Terrel 4/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-04-17T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1573275812982685/", "description": "FRESH + FIT!\nStarting April 1, babo and FitPoint want to help you optimize your diet and fitness.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-04-18T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1725654407681535/", "description": "Oats & Woes & Babo, Oh My!\n\nBabo presents Oats & Woes Ann Arbor a local oatmeal pop-up!

They\u2019re the soundtrack to breaking glass, and an ode to the beauty of brokenness.\n\nThey say that the mark of intelligence is the ability to hold two disparate and conflicting truths in the mind at the same time: I am a good person; I am not a good person. We Disappear lives in this delicate, in-between place: at once hard and noisy, while also soft and personal. And seeming contradictions abound on this album. We Disappear is an all-too-real, dark, and intensely personal album \u2013 in the past most of singer Hutch Harris\u2019 lyrics have been mostly fictitious tales \u2013 about how we try to outrun demise, whether personal or physical. It is an emotional document of how two people can tear each other apart, while simultaneously making you wanna get up and jump around the room.\n\nThe deeply dark, yet oddly catchy \u201cHeart Went Cold\u201d plays on the double metaphor of loss of love/life and features the sad realization \u201cI pushed you away\u201d, but is immediately followed by the super poppy \u201coh-oh oh\u201d. The classic fucking rock anthem \u201cHey You\u201d is a paranoid fantasy about running from the Grim Reaper as he calls after you, about \u201cbeing terrified of death,\u201d says Harris, but \u201ca celebration of that feeling as opposed to feeling sad about it.\u201d A surprisingly uplifting eulogy of the death of a relationship, \u201cThinking Of You\u201d is explained by Harris as \u201cone of the most straight-forward love songs we\u2019ve ever written, a point-blank post-break up song. It\u2019s a song that says exactly what it means. It and a lot of the record are about regret, i.e. still loving someone after a break-up and hanging on to these feelings.\u201d\n\nWe Disappear is also about separation in terms of technology, how it can isolate us and impact our relationships, and how humans have embraced it to the point where we\u2019ve already assimilated into it. \u201cThe Great Dying\u201d and \u201cInto the Code\u201d examine how we\u2019re so afraid we\u2019re going to be forgotten, or overlooked, that we upload everything about our lives onto the Internet.\n\nHarris explains, \u201cTechnology, love and death are the three obsessions of the record. Our privacy used to be so important to us and now everything has changed \u2013 we freely offer once private information about relationships and reveal everything about our day-to-day lives. We\u2019re trying to preserve our life digitally so when we\u2019re gone people won\u2019t forget us. We\u2019re using technology to become immortal. You can even set up Facebook and Twitter accounts to continue updating after you die! We Disappear is about how humans fight the inevitable.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure you want to know that the record will come out March 25th, 2016 on Saddle Creek, that it features the longest running Thermals line-up of Hutch Harris, Kathy Foster, and Westin Glass, and that it was recorded in Portland, OR at Kung Fu Bakery (The Shins, Tegan and Sara) and in Seattle, WA at The Hall of Justice (Nirvana, Mudhoney), and produced by Chris Walla (formerly of Death Cab For Cutie). But what really matters is that this record GETS IT. It walks that fine line between truth and lies, between death and life, between depression and joy \u2013 all the while recognizing that one cannot exist without the other. And it brings us with it. That\u2019s the reason to listen to this record: Because it\u2019s a fucking great album, by an amazing band.

Diane also grew up in Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor and is a graduate of Greenhills School.\n\nHarbour Island, only three miles long and half a mile wide, is one of the oldest settlements in the Bahamas and is best known for its broad pink-sand beaches and for bonefishing, a compelling catch-and-release enterprise that pits a determined angler against an inedible, surprisingly powerful, and elusive quarry.\n\nYoung and fearless Flossie lives on Harbour Island and has a persistent dream is to go fishing with the legendary guide Bonefish Joe, a beloved island institution who picks up his wealthy clients at the dock and returns with them hours later, fishless but satisfied.

Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Backin the Ring. Chris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet,Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, TheLumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records. Chris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases.In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist. Her latest album, Backin the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimedHow I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons. \u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms.For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards. \n\nWSG: Anna Vogelzang\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/595", "name": "Chris Pureka w/ Anna Vogelzang 4/28/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-04-28T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/837506396394371/", "description": "The second season for AFC Ann Arbor kicks off April 29th at 7PM with a friendly against Oakland County FC.  \n\nBeginnng at 5pm, supporters will gather at Arbor Brewing Company for prematch festivities at the Official Pub of AFC Ann Arbor.

Chris will be joined in conversation by Brit Bennett, author of The Mothers (coming from Riverhead in October).\n\nA vivid and assured work of fiction from a major new voice, following the life of a young man growing up, leaving home, and coming back again, marked by the stark beauty of California's Mojave Desert and the various fates of those who leave and those who stay behind. This series of powerful, intertwining stories illuminates Daley Kushner's world--the family, friends and community that have both formed and constrained him, and his new lief in San Francisco. Back home, the desert preys on those who cannot conform: an alfalfa farmer on the outskirts of town; two young girls whose curiosity leads to danger; a black politician who once served as his school's confederate mascot; Daley's mother, an immigrant from Armenia; and Daley himself, introspective and queer. Meanwhile, in another desert on the other side of the world, war threatens to fracture Daley's most meaningful--and most fraught--connection to home, his friendship with Robert Karinger. A luminous debut, Desert Boys traces the development of towns into cities, of boys into men, and the haunting effects produced when the two transformations overlap. Both a bildungsroman and a portrait of a changing place, the book mines the terrain between the desire to escape and the hunger to belong.\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is hilarious, devious, original, and unforgettable; Chris McCormick writes with a joyful swerve and swagger that is all his own.\u201d\u2015Karen Russell, New York Times bestselling author of Vampires in the Lemon Grove\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is a show off's debut, the work of an unabashed polyglot. There seems to be nothing Chris McCormick can't do: smartypants metafictional experiment, heart-pounding thriller, eulogy for boyhood bonds, meditation on sexuality and post-9/11 intolerance. These linked stories assemble into a kind of compound eye through which we glimpse an oft-forgotten corner of California and, most superbly, a fresh take on masculine Americana. McCormick is the artsy outsider, the affectionate anthropologist, the near-feral boy with a wide-angle lens of history.\u201d\u2015Claire Vaye Watkins, author of Battleborn and Gold Fame Citrus\n\n\"In the hands of this young master of purified prose, ambition, love, and the restlessness of boyhood are trapped as if in a crystal vial. No reader will be able to turn away.\"\u2015Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen\n\n\u201cChris McCormick\u2019s book is a gift from the new West. In the dry, highland exurbs of Los Angeles and other exotic places, McCormick crafts lustrous tales of brotherhood, immigrants, love, and paintball. Filled with unforgettable characters, Desert Boys is a deeply moving journey through the natural and emotional landscapes of the American present.\u201d\u2015H\u00e9ctor Tobar, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Down Dark and The Barbarian Nurseries\n\n\u201cThis is a book about place, or really like so many books about place (Dubliners, Winesburg, Ohio) two places, in this case two Californias\u2015San Francisco on the one hand; the less familiar but finely evoked small desert community from which the narrator originates on the other. But it's also a book about shame, two shames, the shame of where we come from, and the shame of leaving it. Through a series of quietly intimate confessions we learn how torn the teller is between past and present, small town and big city, and McCormick captures this tension beautifully in the contrast between his laconic, but frankly feeling prose and his restless formal innovation. Wise and vulnerable by turns, this is a quietly stunning debut.\u201d\u2015Peter Ho Davies, author of The Welsh Girl\n\nChris McCormick was raised in the Antelope Valley. He earned his B.A. at the University of California, Berkeley, and his M.F.A. at the University of Michigan, where he was the recipient of two Hopwood Awards.

Then the mines closed, and the town wore away like a bar of soap. Now Bakerton has been granted a surprise third act: it sits squarely atop the Marcellus Shale, a massive deposit of natural gas. To drill or not to drill?  Prison guard Rich Devlin leases his mineral rights to finance his dream of farming. He doesn\u2019t count on the truck traffic and nonstop noise, his brother\u2019s skepticism or the paranoia of his wife, Shelby, who insists the water smells strange and is poisoning their frail daughter.  Meanwhile his neighbors, organic dairy farmers Mack and Rena, hold out against the drilling\u2014until a passionate environmental activist disrupts their lives.\n\nHeat and Light depicts a community blessed and cursed by its natural resources. Soaring, ambitious, it zooms from drill rig to shareholders\u2019 meeting to the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor to the ruined landscape of the \u201cstrippins,\u201d haunting reminders of Pennsylvania\u2019s past energy booms.  This is a dispatch from a forgotten America\u2014a work of searing moral clarity from one of the finest writers of her generation, a courageous and necessary book.\n\n\u201cHeat and Light achieves pure novelistic virtuosity.

This event is sponsored by the Michigan Humanities Council and is free and open to the public.\n\nStation Eleven is an audacious, darkly glittering novel about art, fame, and ambition set in the eerie days of civilization's collapse. One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time\u2014from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as The Travelling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains\u2014this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet. Sometimes terrifying, sometimes tender, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it.\n\nEmily St. John Mandel is the author of four novels, most recently Station Eleven, which was a finalist for a National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award, and won the 2015 Arthur C. Clarke Award. A previous novel, The Singer's Gun, was the 2014 winner of the Prix Mystere de la Critique in France.

May 11 | 9pm | 18+ | $20 Cover\n\nHailing from Oakland, California, Del the Funky Homosapien and his crew, the Hieroglyphics came out as a markedly non-gangster response to a burgeoning West Coast scene. After being put on at the tender age of 17 by his cousin Ice Cube, Del released two records on Elektra, I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991) and No Need For Alarm (1993). Despite record sales in the hundreds of thousands, he recorded a third album, Future Development, which was never commercially released. Del parted with Elektra and started work on the Hieroglyphics..family album, 3rd Eye Vision (Hiero Imperium, 1998). Hiero went on the road and toured incessantly in support of the album for much of 1998. Del also spent a good portion of his time drawing, practicing Japanese, and playing mass amounts of video games. Finally ready to unleash a new record on the world, Del comes with BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. Seventeen tracks of pure Del. He says of his work on this album: ..\"I've had complete control\". At times, Del has felt restrained by the formulas in hip hop and the expectations fans place upon emcees who have had hits. I wish that I had the same freedom that someone like Bjork has when she puts out an album..Apart from collaborations with PrincePaul, El-P (Company Flow), and help from a few of his Hiero cohorts (A-plus, Casual, Domino) Del handled the majority of production on this album. By staying true to himself, Del has earned legions of adoring fans. He may have said it best in his classic, Mistadobalina when he declared all in the mind and the heart.

These techniques provided a source of physical and spiritual strength when devastating illness struck her family. Inspired by the Buddha\u2019s transformational teachings, she set out to learn as much as she could about who he was. By profession a librarian, Shelley immersed herself in research on the time, place, and spiritual traditions that 2500 years ago produced Prince Siddhartha, who became the Buddha. Yoga, in some form, has a role in all of these traditions. While studying yoga\u2019s history, Shelley began her own practice, which proved as transformational as Buddhist meditation.\n\nBecause she loves historical fiction, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha. Unsatisfied with what she found, she decided to write her own. Her research had sparked her curiosity about Yasodhara, the woman who became Siddhartha\u2019s wife, and she became inspired by the personal and spiritual struggles of women who knew him. She began to write the Sadhana trilogy, three novels that tell their stories.\n\nShelley hung up her black belt to practice Iyengar yoga. Both disciplines have enriched her world and the world of her books.\n\n'The Tigress and the Yogi'\n\nA talking tigress...a wandering yogi...\n\nWhen the outcaste girl Mala meets these two, it sets her on a journey from slavery to freedom through an ancient land where chaos threatens gods and mortals alike.

Born in Trim, Co. Meath, to John Keenan, Sr. of Westmeath and the former Mary Bravender of Co. Cavan. The Keenans were a Travelling family steeped in traditional music; both Paddy's father and grandfather were uilleann pipers. Paddy himself took up the pipes at the age of ten, playing his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, when he was 14. He later played with the rest of his family in a group called The Pavees. At 17, having fallen in love with the blues, Paddy left Ireland for England and Europe, where he played blues and rock. Returning to Ireland after a few years, he began playing around Dublin with singer/keyboardist Triona Ni Dhomhnaill and singer/guitarist Micheal O Dhomhnaill. Fiddler Paddy Glackin joined the three, then flute player Matt Molloy, accordionist Tony MacMahon, and guitarist Donal Lunny. Thus was born one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, The Bothy Band. Paddy was one of the band's founding members, and his virtuosity on the pipes combined with the ferocity of his playing made him, in the opinion of many, its driving force. Bothy Band-mate Donal Lunny once described Paddy as \"the Jimi Hendrix of the pipes\".\n\nSince the breakup of The Bothy Band in 1979, Paddy has toured as a soloist, bringing the finest example of traditional Irish music and uilleann piping to audiences around the globe, performing in Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Australia, across Europe, Russia, and of course America.\n\nVisit Paddy on the web here: http://www.paddykeenan.com/", "name": "Paddy Keenan- In Concert", "date": "2016-05-22T17:30:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1532863607016540/", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n- May 24 Heather Schwartz\nhttp://www.heatherschwartzmusic.com/\n\nHeather Schwartz has become known for creating a unique concert experience, with a vintage charm and passionate vocals she truely connects with her audience.

Many of her publications in the scientific literature highlight concerns and conditions of women, such as the first study of women\u2019s reactions to the use of fetal monitoring during labor. She has served on the editorial board of the Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology. She is a recognized expert on the effects of stress hormones on mood and on brain structure. Dr. Starkman has also published in The New Republic and Vogue magazine.\n\nWhen a seemingly miraculous pregnancy following years battling infertility ends in a late miscarriage, Margo is devastated.  For a time, the unshakable yet false belief that she is pregnant again provides relief from all-consuming grief. When her fantasy inevitably clashes with reality, Margo falls into a deep depression requiring admission to a psychiatric unit. Uncertain if the sometimes-chaotic environment there is helping or making her worse, Margo seizes an opportunity to flee. Alone on the city streets, new fantasies propel her to commit a crime with dangerous consequences for herself and others.\n      \nThis stirring portrait by a prominent psychiatrist  of one woman\u2019s psychological unraveling takes readers on a journey across the blurred boundaries between sanity and depression, madness and healing.", "name": "Join Us - Book Launch Party for Ann Arbor Author Monica Starkman for Her New Novel 'the end of miracles'", "date": "2016-05-24T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1176167649079840/", "description": "Our May Artists' Meet & Greet topic is \nHow to Submit Your Artwork to a Show or Gallery.

Now, he issues the sharpest entry of his vision, the majestic The Blackberry Train engineered by Steve Albini (Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been an evolution,\u201d James says. \u201cThis set of songs definitely has a harder edge, but it\u2019s a continuation of the last album. The main thing for me is to not conform or compromise.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 panoramic artistry is inspired by such diverse musicians as Kurt Cobain, The Smiths, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, The Cure, The Beatles, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, and Hank Williams. His fingerprint aesthetic has earned him plaudits from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Daily News. He\u2019s earned a strong following the old fashioned way, through tirelessly touring the US, Europe and the UK, and playing bigger and bigger shows with each go around.\n\nThe Blackberry Train is an epiphanic co-mingling of aesthetics. James sought out the distinct audio stylings of Steve Albini to conjure a grungier sensibility. He welcomed the engineer\u2019s gifts for capturing music with a raw clarity, and Steve Albini\u2019s reputation for not impinging on an artist\u2019s vision. The results make for an eclectic album with fastidiously crafted songs documented in the studio with glorious purity.\n\n\u201cI like the music to have elements of the avant garde, psychedelic, and be just a little against the grain,\u201d James reveals. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about having as much emotion as possible for me, musically and lyrically. It\u2019s all about the music being cathartic, heartfelt and true.\u201d\n\nThe Blackberry Train manages to be both diverse and cohesive. The album opens invigoratingly with the jangling rocker, \u201cToo Hard\u201d and closes with the stately and aptly named folk song \u201cPeace and Stillness.\u201d Between these bookends, highlights include the rough-edged and urgently melodic \u201cUnicorn,\u201d the anthemic \u201cPeyote Coyote,\u201d and the soulful ballad \u201cPrayer.\u201d One very personal song is the winsome and reflective \u201cWaterfall\u201d which was inspired by memories of his mother.\n\nThis summer and fall James will embark on extensive tour dates in the U.S. Thinking ahead, James says: \u201cI just want to keep on going, keep working, and improving as a songwriter. I\u2019d love to feel that I realized my full potential both as a person, and as a songwriter. That feels like a great, fulfilling goal to shoot for. Making a lot of music, and striving for more depth artistically\u2013those are my goals.\u201d", "name": "James McCartney 6/20/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-06-20T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/842589652537183/", "description": "Capturing an irresistibly bright and uplifting sound, musical pioneer and humanitarian Michael Franti and Spearhead's globally conscious reggae pop anthems are spreading some much appreciated positivity worldwide.

That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.

September 24 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nThe Slackers are self styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll from New York City. The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-09-24T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/472892626244546/", "description": "Where song, spirit, and speaking meet.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/257954421222460/", "description": "Our Monthly Beer tasting series explore the expansive world of beer through the lens of different themes.
