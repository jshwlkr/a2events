Returning after graduation to pursue his journalistic dreams, Savitt finds himself in the midst of historic news stories. The book vividly describes his 17 years of knowing China as intimately as an American can, during which he sees its cultural and economic flowering. He also observes the Tiananmen Square massacre, where he dodges bullets and fights the urge to participate, not just witness. His creation of China\u2019s first independent English-language newspaper gets him noticed, first by the Beijing bureaus of Western media outlets and then by the Communist Party. He comes across as a risk taker whose wealthy family back home could only help him so much\u2014his activist reporting style eventually leads to solitary confinement and a hunger strike.

Julia will be joined in conversation by Professor William Uricchio.\n\nHow do stories of particular events turn into global myths, while others fade away? What becomes known and seen as a global iconic event? In Stories without Borders, Julia Sonnevend considers the ways in which we recount and remember news stories of historic significance. Focusing on journalists covering the fall of the Berlin Wall and on subsequent retellings of the event in a variety of ways - from Legoland reenactments to slabs of the Berlin Wall installed in global cities - Sonnevend discusses how certain events become built up so that people in many parts of the world remember them for long periods of time. She argues that five dimensions determine the viability and longevity of international news events. First, a foundational narrative must be established with certain preconditions. Next, the established narrative becomes universalized and a mythical message developed. This message is then condensed and encapsulated in a simple phrase, a short narrative, and a recognizable visual scene. Counter-narratives emerge that reinterpret events and in turn facilitate their diffusion across multiple media platforms and changing social and political contexts. Sonnevend examines these five elements through the developments of November 9, 1989 - what came to be known as the fall of the Berlin Wall. Stories Without Borders concludes with a discussion of how global iconic events have an enduring effect on individuals and societies, pointing out that after common currencies, military alliances, and international courts have failed, stories may be all that we have to bring hope and unity.\n\nJulia Sonnevend is Assistant Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Michigan. She was a Lady Davis Fellow at the Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace in Israel in 2014 and a Leibniz Fellow at the Center for Contemporary History in Germany in 2015. She is co-editor of Education and Social Media: Toward a Digital Future (forthcoming with MIT Press in 2016). She is author and co-author of articles published in journals including Journalism Studies, Columbia Journalism Review and The New Everyday. Her work also appears in edited collections including Digital Keywords: A Vocabulary of Information Society and Culture (Ed. Benjamin Peters, Princeton University Press, forthcoming in 2016), Iconic Power: Materiality and Meaning in Social Life (Eds. Jeffrey C. Alexander et al, Palgrave Macmillan, 2012) and Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing Through the Discipline (Eds. James Elkins et al, Routledge, 2012).

He is Professor of Comparative Media Studies at MIT, Principal Investigator of the MIT Open Documentary Lab, and faculty director of the MISTI-Netherlands Program.

Although communication to the outside world was limited, Florentine film director Franco Zeffirelli, who was editing his Taming of the Shrew in Rome, heard about it and rushed to his beloved city to film the days immediately after the flood. His documentary is titled Per Firenze (For Florence), and the English version is Florence: Days of Destruction; both are narrated by Richard Burton. The English version will be shown at this event. A year after the flood, Roger Hill, instructor of film-making at the Royal College of Art, London, documented the conservation and restoration efforts at the National Library, Florence, where over a million books were damaged during the flood. Shown in this film are scenes of the conservation of mud-covered, battered books as well as demonstrations of a limp- vellum and a full-leather binding, the techniques and materials used to recover thousands of books missing their bindings. Hill's film is titled: The Restoration of Books, Florence, 1968.\n\nThis program is part of the national symposium, \u201cThe Flood in Florence, 1966: A Fifty-Year Retrospective\u201d that explores the transformative effects of this disaster on the preservation field.

It's a constantly moving showcase of two television icons who pull no punches when battering the audience with \"Batman and Robin\" or \"The Shit Rap.\" The innocent honesty of an out- of-control drunken ex-cop Trailer Park Supervisor and his side-kick Randybobandy the cheeseburger eating ex male prostitute, weekend Trailer Park Supervisor is pants pissing humour at its warmest.\n\nThe show itself is roughly based on the T.V. series and movies, but being live, necessitates a different format and different is the operative word here. There is nothing like it anywhere. Shit talk and poetry; sodomy and sweet talk all thrown together with music and mayhem. What more could a room full of fun seekers want.", "date": "2016-11-04T09:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/261603764205728/", "name": "Randy & Mr. Lahey 11/4/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Ernestine and Herbert Ruben Study Center for Works on Paper\nSpace is limited and registration is required.

November 10 | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nTucker Beathard  wsg: Aubrie Sellers\nPresented by: 102.9 W4 Country\n\nTucker Beathard - Growing up in a family that excelled at both music and sports \u2014 his father is a hit songwriter; his brothers, star quarterbacks \u2014 Big Machine Label Group recording artist Tucker Beathard has an unrelenting competitive spirit: He wakes up every day trying to write the perfect song. For Tucker, a self-taught guitarist and drummer, there's no such thing as \"good enough.\"   \"I love anything with great melodies and I'm drawn to the little things,\" Tucker says, rattling off his influences with an artist's attention to detail. \"When I listen to Led Zeppelin, I focus on John Bonham's drums. Or Joe Walsh's guitar licks in the Eagles. And Hank Williams Jr.'s 'Family Tradition' is as country songwriting as it gets.\"  Tucker certainly knows something about family tradition, taking cues from dad Casey Beathard, who wrote Kenny Chesney's \"Don't Blink\" and Eric Church's \"Homeboy.\" The latter, in fact, was inspired by Tucker, who admits to going through his own rebellious phase.  Giving up a college baseball scholarship to dive headlong into songwriting, Tucker came out better for his diverse experiences and documented those wild times in the wise-beyond-its-years \"Momma and Jesus.\" The track is one of many in contention for his debut album, being overseen by producer Angelo Petraglia (Kings Of Leon).   With a rhythmic way of playing guitar, influenced by his innate drumming ability, Tucker has created some of contemporary country music's most progressive songs. \"Rock On,\" a song about regretting the girl that got away, is taut in its delivery, with clever turns of phrase. Likewise, \"20-10 Tennessee,\" a standout, uses a football game as metaphor for a relationship and \u201cBetter Than Me\u201d puts a unique spin on an arena-ready breakup anthem, ultimately wishing the best for someone after parting ways.   \"I've always been a huge fan of deep songs, and I've always liked poems,\" he says. \"I'm an introvert, but writing songs that go beneath the surface allows me the chance to open up a piece of myself.\"   As does his engaging live show.  Having played with artists like Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert, Tucker regularly bares his soul in front of a crowd.

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\n\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\n\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\n\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal.

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "date": "2016-11-17T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/619658961515550/", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "date": "2016-11-18T15:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/360781184260443/", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe"}, {"description": "Art Off The Wall 2016 is the Ann Arbor Art Center's BIGGEST Holiday Exhibition and Shopping Event ever!

After the ride, we will have some pizza and refreshments at the lodge at about 12:30 PM.  Please register in advance at Event Brite to attend so a good estimate of riders can be made for the pizza and beverages.  Rain date will be Saturday 11/26 at 10 AM.  Look for changes in schedule on the Rolling Hills or Hewens Creek forums on the MMBA website, the Poto Yahoo! Group Email list, the Poto MBA Facebook page or Poto MBA Twitter account.\n\nPlease park in the MTB trail head parking lot:  enter the park, go straight through the traffic circle and park in the first lot on your right next to a big pavilion ~1/4 mile west of the circle.

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound. With support from the likes of Diplo, Omarion, and JoJo, plus tours with artists like Chance the Rapper, Flume and Chet Faker, the producer has clearly caught the eye some of a wide variety of tastemakers. Featured by the likes of Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Boiler Room and The FADER, Cuna has also received admiration from music journalists the world over, drawing almost universal praise from disparate outlets. With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory. And that\u2019s part of the reason why Cuna connects with his fan base on such a visceral level, eschewing traditional industry methods for his own unique, intimate manner of going about business.\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/768", "date": "2016-12-02T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1759418600997980/", "name": "Sweater Beats12/2/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Gift Certificates with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get a free $50 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Combo Package \nFor only $75 get a $50 Gift Card and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks \n\nOur Gift Cards and MSV Combo Package can be purchased at our restaurant,\n by calling (888) 456-3463 (DINE), or visit us online at: www.mainstreetventuresinc.com/shop. \n\nTake advantage of this special offer.

While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "date": "2016-12-14T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1574155032886638/", "name": "Dopapod & Pigeons Playing Ping Pong at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Katie Geddes sings traditional and contemporary folk, country-folk, and folk-pop tunes.

The program includes transcriptions of excerpts from The Art of the Fugue and various keyboard works, as well as organ and viola da gamba trio sonatas.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/yo-yo-ma-edgar-meyer-chris-thile/", "date": "2017-04-22T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197458777307457/", "name": "Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer & Chris Thile"}, {"description": "New music!", "date": "2017-04-23T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/607630666085884/", "name": "Paula Cole"}, {"description": "Contemporary opera composer Jake Heggie enthused in Gramophone magazine, \u201cThe staggering, joyful artistry of Joyce DiDonato reminds us that in any generation there are a few giants\u2026Those who know her repertoire are in awe of her gifts, and those who know nothing of it are instantly engaged.\u201d\n\nDiDonato enchants audiences across the globe with her 24-carat voice and performances that \u201cleave one bereft of superlatives.\u201d (The Telegraph) This concert opera with The English Concert and conductor Harry Bicket will be performed in only two places in the country: Hill Auditorium and Carnegie Hall.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/handels-ariodante/", "date": "2017-04-25T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1003698069678193/", "name": "Handel\u2019s Ariodante"}, {"description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Gift Certificates with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get a free $50 Gift Certificate for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Combo Package \nFor only $75 get a $50 Gift Card and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks \n\nOur Gift Cards and MSV Combo Package can be purchased at our restaurant,\n by calling (888) 456-3463 (DINE), or visit us online at: www.mainstreetventuresinc.com/shop. \n\nTake advantage of this special offer.
