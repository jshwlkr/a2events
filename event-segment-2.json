HSHV accepts and distributes 40,000 pounds of pet food each year, and we're grateful for the work they do as well as their participation in this event. Food donations, as well as donations by cash or check, will be accepted at the event, or you can donate online. \n\nNow regarded as a classic in dog literature, Ken Foster's memoir chronicles his journey from first-time dog owner to rescuer\u2014and all the lessons and mistakes he made along the way. Bookended by the tragedies of 9/11 and Katrina, Foster finds that dogs open his eyes to the benefits of compassion, selflessness, and the chaotic beauty of living each day in the moment. \n\nBut more than Foster's own story, readers remember the dogs. Among them are Duque, a Costa Rican stray; Brando, Foster's first adopted dog and a supposed pit bull mix who outgrew his Manhattan studio apartment; Rocco, a clownish red pit bull whose owner mistakenly gives him away to the wrong person; Zephyr, a cheerful Rottweiler mix who awakens Foster by sitting on his chest when his heart stops working; and Sula, the tiny lost pit bull who showed up at Foster's door one day and stayed. \n\nWhether bearing witness to national tragedy, grieving the death of a friend, or dealing with his own mortality, Foster finds strength in his dogs, and in the reciprocal nature of rescue. \n\n\"Generosity and gratitude power this compelling account of the reciprocal nature of rescue. Ken Foster illuminates a profound lesson about saving a life: Doing it makes you able to do it.\"\u2013Amy Hempel, author of The Dog of the Marriage and Reasons to Live\n\nKen Foster is the editor of two anthologies, including Dog Culture, and the author of Dogs I Have Met and I\u2019m a Good Dog.

Peter will be joined in conversation by the University of Michigan's Jesse Hoffnung-Garskof. Refreshments will be provided thanks to UM's Eisenberg Institute for Historical Studies and Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, generous co-sponsors of this event. \n\nAbout Back Channel to Cuba:\n\nHistory is being made in U.S.-Cuban relations. Updated to tell the real story behind the stunning December 17, 2014 announcement by President Obama and President Castro of their move to restore full diplomatic relations, this powerful book is essential to understanding ongoing efforts toward normalization in a new era of engagement. Challenging the conventional wisdom of perpetual conflict and aggression between the United States and Cuba since 1959, Back Channel to Cuba chronicles a surprising, untold history of bilateral efforts toward rapprochement and reconciliation. William M. LeoGrande and Peter Kornbluh here present a remarkably new and relevant account, describing how, despite the intense political clamor surrounding efforts to improve relations with Havana, negotiations have been conducted by every presidential administration since Eisenhower's through secret, back-channel diplomacy. From John F. Kennedy's offering of an olive branch to Fidel Castro after the missile crisis, to Henry Kissinger's top secret quest for normalization, to Barack Obama's promise of a new approach, LeoGrande and Kornbluh uncovered hundreds of formerly secret U.S. documents and conducted interviews with dozens of negotiators, intermediaries, and policy makers, including Fidel Castro and Jimmy Carter. They reveal a fifty-year record of dialogue and negotiations, both open and furtive, that provides the historical foundation for the dramatic breakthrough in U.S.-Cuba ties. \n\nPeter Kornbluh directs the Cuba Documentation Project and the Chile Documentation Project at the National Security Archive in Washington, DC, and is co-author, with William M. LeoGrande, of Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations Between Washington and Havana. Kornbluh is also the author of The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability and Bay of Pigs Declassified: The Secret CIA Report on the Invasion of Cuba. He writes regularly for The Nation.\n\nJesse Hoffnung-Garskof is Associate Professor of History, American Culture, and Latina/o Studies at the University of Michigan.

HSHV accepts and distributes 40,000 pounds of pet food each year, and we're grateful for the work they do as well as their participation in this event. Food donations, as well as donations by cash or check, will be accepted at the event, or you can donate online. \n\nNow regarded as a classic in dog literature, Ken Foster's memoir chronicles his journey from first-time dog owner to rescuer\u2014and all the lessons and mistakes he made along the way. Bookended by the tragedies of 9/11 and Katrina, Foster finds that dogs open his eyes to the benefits of compassion, selflessness, and the chaotic beauty of living each day in the moment. \n\nBut more than Foster's own story, readers remember the dogs. Among them are Duque, a Costa Rican stray; Brando, Foster's first adopted dog and a supposed pit bull mix who outgrew his Manhattan studio apartment; Rocco, a clownish red pit bull whose owner mistakenly gives him away to the wrong person; Zephyr, a cheerful Rottweiler mix who awakens Foster by sitting on his chest when his heart stops working; and Sula, the tiny lost pit bull who showed up at Foster's door one day and stayed. \n\nWhether bearing witness to national tragedy, grieving the death of a friend, or dealing with his own mortality, Foster finds strength in his dogs, and in the reciprocal nature of rescue. \n\n\"Generosity and gratitude power this compelling account of the reciprocal nature of rescue. Ken Foster illuminates a profound lesson about saving a life: Doing it makes you able to do it.\"\u2013Amy Hempel, author of The Dog of the Marriage and Reasons to Live\n\nKen Foster is the editor of two anthologies, including Dog Culture, and the author of Dogs I Have Met and I\u2019m a Good Dog.

In Norwegian folklore, it is a spirit who sometimes appears as a white horse that steals children away. In Nathan Hill\u2019s remarkable first novel, a Nix is anything you love that one day disappears, taking with it a piece of your heart. It\u2019s 2011, and Samuel Andresen-Anderson\u2014college professor, stalled writer\u2014has a Nix of his own: his mother, Faye. He hasn\u2019t seen her in decades, not since she abandoned the family when he was a boy. Now she\u2019s reappeared, having committed an absurd crime that electrifies the nightly news, beguiles the internet, and inflames a politically divided country. The media paints Faye as a radical hippie with a sordid past, but as far as Samuel knows, his mother was an ordinary girl, who married her high-school sweetheart. Which version of his mother is true? Two facts are certain: she\u2019s facing some serious charges, and she needs Samuel\u2019s help.\n\nTo save her, Samuel will have to embark on his own journey, uncovering long-buried secrets about the woman he thought he knew, secrets that take him across generations and countries, and stretch all the way back to Norway, the original home of the mysterious Nix. In doing so, Samuel will not only confront Faye\u2019s losses, but also his own lost love, and relearn everything he thought he knew about his mother, and himself. From the suburban Midwest to New York City to the 1968 riots that rocked Chicago, and beyond, The Nix explores\u2014with sharp humor and a fierce tenderness\u2014the resilience of love and home, even in times of radical change\n\n\"The Nix is a mother-son psychodrama with ghosts and politics, but it\u2019s also a tragicomedy about anger and sanctimony in America. Even the minor characters go to extremes\u2014among them, a Home Ec teacher from Hell and an unrepentant plagiarist with presidential aspirations. \u2018A maestro of being awful,\u2019 the son calls his mom. \u2018Every memory is really a scar,\u2019 she tells him. For this mother and son, disappointment is \u2018the price of hope\u2019\u2014a cost they will both bear. Nathan Hill is a maestro of being terrific.\" \u2014 John Irving\n\n\"Pay attention. This is what a Great American Novel looks like. The Nix is culturally relevant, politically charged, historically sweeping, sad, full of yearning, sometimes dark but mostly hilarious. Nathan Hill is a literary powerhouse who will deservedly earn many comparisons to John Irving and Jonathan Franzen.\" \u2014 Benjamin Percy\n\n\u201cOnce in a while a novel arrives at the perfect moment to reflect, skewer, and provide context for the world as we know it. This\u2014now\u2014is that novel.\u201d \u2014 Christina Baker Kline\n\nNathan Hill's short stories have appeared in The Iowa Review, AGNI, Gulf Coast, The Denver Quarterly, Fugue, The Gettysburg Review, and many other journals.

Not your typical sports memoir, Chasing Water also contains arresting black-and-white drawings and a graphic story extra, as well as an inventive and mercurial narrative style that morphs chapter by chapter to reflect Ervin\u2019s restless, multifaceted life. Ervin won a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games at the age of nineteen. He is an athlete branded with a slew of titles including being the first US Olympic swimmer of African American descent, along with Jewish heritage, who also grew up with Tourette\u2019s syndrome. He shocked the sporting world by retiring soon after claiming two world titles following the 2000 Olympics. Auctioning off his gold medal for charity, he set off on a part spiritual quest, part self-destructive bender that involved Zen temples, fast motorcycles, tattoo parlors, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands. Then Ervin resurfaced in 2012 to not only make the US Olympic team twelve years after his first appearance, but to continue his career by swimming faster than ever before, and faster than anyone else. \n\n\"Here Ervin and swim trainer and journalist Markides combine talents to create a biography that is part first-hand narrative by Ervin, with Markides filling in the details and providing context. The formula works, pulling readers into Ervin's experience of the thrill of victory and search for meaning....Featuring more depth, breadth, truth, and the effects of reckless choices than found in traditional athlete biographies, this gripping account is just in time for the gear up to the Rio 2016 Olympics. Readers will understand the psyche and life of elite athletes as never before, then cheer Ervin on in his attempt to make another Olympic team.\"--Library Journal\n\n\"A celebrated Olympian recounts how he rose to the top of his sport, crashed, and found redemption....This book, which tells his story through a narrative that interweaves the former gold medalist's memories with commentary by his friend and colleague Markides, reveals the extreme highs and lows that characterized Ervin's remarkable life and career....The author never flinches at revealing his less-than-perfect past, and the humility he demonstrates at coming to terms with his own egotism and personal shortcomings makes the book frequently compelling. A provocative and refreshingly honest redemption memoir.\"--Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"Markides smartly combines his own journalistic account with a parallel narrative in which Ervin...explains his life and style. Some talents simply defy explanation, however, and Ervin may be in that category....The story of his comeback at 31 (ancient for a swimmer) is rendered more amazing by the contrast with what went before.\"--Booklist \n\n\"Most memoirs from Olympians are puff pieces, ghost-written so blandly you fall asleep trying to make it to the end of the first chapter.

At age seven she was put on the boys' soccer team. At age thirty five she would become the highest goal scorer--male or female--in the history of soccer, capturing the nation's heart with her team's 2015 World Cup Championship. Called an inspiration (and \"badass\" by President Obama), Abby has become a fierce advocate for women's rights and equal opportunity, pushing to translate the success of her team to the real world. As she reveals in this searching memoir, Abby's professional success often masked her inner struggle to reconcile the various parts of herself: ferocious competitor, daughter, leader, wife. \n\nWith stunning candor, Abby shares her inspiring and often brutal journey from girl in Rochester, New York, to world class athlete. Far more than a sports memoir, Forward is gripping tale of resilience and redemption and a reminder that heroism is, above all, about embracing life's challenges with fearlessness and heart.\n\nAbout the Event\n\nFeaturing a conversation with Doug Tribou, host of Morning Edition for Michigan Radio, and former reporter and producer for NPR's Only A Game, this event will take place at Rackham Auditorium on September 17th, 2016, at 7pm. Doors for seating will open at 6:15pm. There are two ticket options: a $10 dollar general admission ticket, and a $30 dollar general admission and hardcover book bundle. Though both ticketing options provide general admission seating, book-bundle ticket holders will have first access to the signing line following the event. Book-bundle ticket holders will pick up their books at the event, and not before.

For two months he danced, filmed, made music, did standup comedy, wrote and much more, untill he found out what he loved doing most: making music. He uploaded a couple of tracks on Youtube and Soundcloud, and Bakermat was born. Since then he stepped in a rollercoaster ride he could have never imagined. First official single \u2018Vandaag (One Day)\u2019 became a huge hit all over Europe hitting top 10 spots in almost every country. The early succes got rewarded with platinum records in France, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. The succes was largely attributed to the fact that he came with an entirely different and new sound, combining minimal and deep house with jazz and soul. It laid a foundation for the genres we now know as \u2018tropical house\u2019 or \u2018melodic house\u2019, in which he is still seen as the founder and pioneer. He keeps trying to bring new and refreshing music out, always trying to be as unique and renewing as possible. A huge succes was his record released in 2015 \u201cTeach Me\u201d where he mixedSoul, Gospel and Disco to a record that set a new standard in the \u2018melodic house\u2019 genre. \n\nBakermat also became well know because of his innovative performances and stage hostings. He did shows in Paris, London and other big cities with an entire band called \u2018The Bakermat Live Band\u2019. In Paris he even played in the legendary L\u2019Olympia with his band, a sold out show. He played at almost every big festival there is over the last 3 years like I Love Techno, Ultra Miami, Sensation White, Mainsquare, Montreux Jazz Festival, Tomorrowland, Mysteryland, South West Four and the list goes on and on. He is also the host of stages at the biggest festivals like the \u2018Bakermat & Friends\u2019 stage at Tomorrowland every year, or the \u201cBakermat\u2019s Gospel Church\u2019 at Kingsday Festival and a lot more. As one of the founders his goal is to bring new talent or fellow colleagues to the stage and that's exactly what he does when he's curating a stage. Artists like Klingande, Thomas Jack, The Avener, Robin Schulz and Oliver Heldens are often guests at one of his stages. Bakermat\u2019s new album \u2018Bon Voyage\u2019 is his first studio album and will be released in 2015, it contains a lot of new material and new styles/ production techniques, because according to Bakermat this was an opportunity for him to \u201c really be free of restrictions and make exactly what I want\u201d. With his album, remixes, releases and confirmed shows at the biggest festivals lined up, it seems 2016 will be a great year for Bakermat once again.\n\n\nWho is Sam Feldt?\n\nDeemed a \"Modern House superstar\" by Billboard, Sam Feldt broke onto the scene in 2013 with remixes including \"On Trees and Birds and Fire\" from I Am Oak. In 2015, he released a remake of \"Show Me Love\" from Robin S. which charted highly across the world. \n\nThe Dutch DJ, born August 1, 1993, is currently signed to Spinnin' Records and most recently released \"Summer On You\", a melodic and deep tropical track with Lucas & Steve featuring Wulf.\n\nwww.PrimeSocial.com\n===============================\nGET INVOLVED: Want to get involved with PSG?

September 24 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nThe Slackers wsg: Duppies\n\nThe Slackers are self styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll from New York City. The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-25T10:30:00-04:00", "name": "The Spunky Sprite and the Endless Night", "description": "\"The Spunky Sprite and the Endless Night\" follows a plucky young sprite who is desperate to learn how Mother Nature brings the world to life each day.

Drawing from her background in Irish dance, and influenced by a diverse musical range from classical to Cape Breton, Aislinn\u2019s distinct style shines through her music in an open and honest way. Known for her syncopated and rhythmic accompaniment, her compositions and arrangements offer a fresh perspective to the Irish music tradition.\n\nRaised immersed in the Irish culture (the shared heritage on both sides of her family) Aislinn learned about Irish customs through dance, music and language lessons. She was drawn to the harp from an early age, and studied with various Irish and Celtic harpers including Janet Harbison and Michael Rooney. Aislinn also spent a semester abroad at the University of Limerick where she worked closely with Irish harper Fionnuala Rooney.\n\nAislinn\u2019s recently released debut solo harp album The Thin Place has been called \u201cstunning, a monumental piece of work from a very talented and driven harper\u201d and \u201cfor a first CD it\u2019s a winner\u201d (Jack Baker of Irish American News). The album blends popular traditional Irish tunes with those less commonly played, and features four of her own compositions including one with the album\u2019s namesake. Joining Aislinn on select tracks are some of Chicago\u2019s finest Irish musicians: Liz Carroll (fiddle), Teresa Shine (fiddle) and John Williams (concertina). Aislinn\u2019s tune The Thin Place and accompanying track is also featured on the Irish Traditional Music Archive\u2019s Newly Composed Tunes and Songs in the Irish Tradition playlist. Listen to a sample here.\n\nFrom performing annually at Irish festivals including the Milwaukee Irish Fest, to private events and traditional Irish music sessions, Aislinn is in high-demand as a performer and keeps a busy schedule. She is a featured musician for the annual iBAM! (Irish Books Arts & Music) Gala Dinner, and played for celebrations honoring the opening of the Ireland: Crossroads of Art & Design, 1690-1840 exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAislinn holds a B.F.A. in Inter-Arts (music and dance), an interdisciplinary major in Ethnic Studies and a certificate in Celtic Studies. She has taught workshops at the Milwaukee Irish Fest School of Music (MIFSM), the Milwaukee Irish Fest Summer School, the Great Lakes Harpers (GLH) Regional Conference, and the Madison Folk Harp Society. Currently Aislinn teaches from her private studio in Chicago and via Skype, is on faculty at the MIFSM, and teaches workshops at the Old Town School of Folk Music.\n\nVisit Aislinn on the web at www.aislinnmusic.com\n\nThis project is partially supported by an Individual Artist Program Grant from the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs & Special Events, as well as a grant from the Illinois Arts Council, a state agency through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1160032467389616/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-25T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Open Stage", "description": "Sunday nights the beer flows as we open the stage to local performers.

King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is No Other Love. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Wolf Eyes, Windy & Carl, Aaron Dilloway: benefit concert", "description": "Maize & Blue Velvet: a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation\nticket proceeds to benefit the Chicago division of the David Lynch Foundation and the Ann Arbor Film Festival\n\nwith special guests\n\nWindy & Carl\n\nWolf Eyes\n\nAaron Dilloway\n\nAbout the Foundation\nThe David Lynch Foundation\u2019s core mission is to heal traumatic stress and raise performance in at risk populations, including veterans suffering from PTSD and mothers and their families who have lost loved ones to violence.

Bassist and producer Kevin Pritchard, recently thawed from an extremely rare prehistoric groove glacier, discovered the forlorn Hertler in a twinkling, mysteriously fortuitous place called The Quilted Attic. Alongside legendary glacier-hunter Rick Hale-who would later spend decades forging a drum set from pure, white-hot, ancient stardust to mark the occasion-Pritchard changed the world: He wrangled Hertler into musical collaboration.

October 27 | 8pm | All Ages | $25 Cover\n\nann arbor's 107one Presents:\nBrett Dennen wsg: Lily & Madeleine\n\nAs common and simple as it is, \"por favor\" is such an evocative expression. From Spanish, it translates to \"please,\" a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. \"Por favor' was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,\" says Brett Dennen. \"We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.\"\n\n\"When you say please, you're asking something to come into your life,\" Dennen adds. \"It might mean that you're weak and need something to make you strong. But you're admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.\"\n\nThat notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen's intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.\n\n\"All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn't feeling confident about myself,\" he says. \"When I'm not feeling confident, I'm not a nice person to be around. I don't take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I'm in that place.\"\n\nA followup to 2013's Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It's the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it's by no means a sad affair, nor is it the \"rainyday record\" Dennen initially thought he was making.\n\nOften framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. \"And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let's go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,\" he sings over a chugging groove on \"Bonfire.\"\n\nOn \"Where We Left Off,\" the album's emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: \"Everyone knows I'm a happy man/ But I haven't been right.\"\n\n\"Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,\" Dennen admits. \"Is there something I'm scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren't in that zone.\"\n\n\"I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,\" he continues. \"I don't have to worry about whether they'll be on the radio or if they're different from my previous stuff.\"\n\nHoled up at Cobb's Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb's insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. \"We recorded it the way people made records in the '60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,\" he says. \"We didn't do anything more than five times. We didn't secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It's not sloppy, but it's in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.\"\n\nCobb adds, \"I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He's very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.\"\n\nMore than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. \"My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,\" he says.\n\nThat marked a detour from his most recent releases. With those he felt like he was exercising his craftsmanship - \"being a songwriter for the sake of being a songwriter,\" as he puts it. \"I really wanted this new album to come across as a whole piece,\" Dennen says. \"I consider it to be a batch of songs that all live together and complement each other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the album title. Please.\n\n\"What was I asking for with this album\" Dennen says. \"I wanted to be a good person and feel good about myself again, but in a way that I knew it was OK to be sad. That's part of life, the ups and downs. But with these songs, I want to make people feel good about themselves and about life through the good and bad.\"\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/718", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1735261526750729/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-28T12:00:00-04:00", "name": "POP-X", "description": "POP-X IS FREE AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC!\n\nPresented by The Ann Arbor Art Center, POP-X is an annual 10-day festival involving pop-up art pavilions, interactive exhibitions, performances and special events in Ann Arbor. \nDuring the ten days that the art pavilions are grouped in Liberty Plaza, visitors of all ages will have the opportunity to interact with these exhibitions, attend lectures and family events, see special performances, and enjoy Ann Arbor\u2019s art scene like never before.\n\nThe pavilions are independently available for sale as well, serving as beautiful yard installations for work or play!\n \nVisit popxannarbor.com for details about the pavilions, the artists, and the full schedule of events! \n----------\n\nPOP-X 2016 ARTISTS: Ann Arbor Women Artists | Beth Billups | FLY Children\u2019s Art Center | Gallery Project | Donald Harrison and Martin Thoburn | Jodi Stuart | Synecdoche Design | Andrew Thompson | Lisa Waud | David Zinn\n----------\n\nTHANK YOU TO OUR GENEROUS SPONSORS:  Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation |  Ann Arbor Area Convention and Visitors Bureau | Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority | Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan | First Martin Corporation | Isalita Cantina and MANI Osteria & Bar | Larry and Lucie Nisson | Old National Bank | Savco Hospitality | Skidmore Studio", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/585713071616738/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-28T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Chuck Brodsky at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "There is no better storyteller than Chuck Brodsky.

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\n\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\n\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\n\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal. It\u2019s a transformation record.\u201d We are so pleased to welcome Mary Gauthier into our Series. www.marygauthier.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/676020209212879/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-13T19:30:00-05:00", "name": "Richard Shindell", "description": "\"A master builder of songs\"\u2014Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/140061109732194/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-14T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Seth Walker", "description": "\"He's the real deal\"\u2014Marcia Ball", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/494085454134532/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-16T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Dave Simonett of Trampled By Turtles and Carl Broemel of My Morning Jacket", "description": "Tickets on sale Friday, 8/19, at 10 a.m. at TheArk.org!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1790043767908763/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-17T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Jay Stielstra", "description": "Michigan's folk songwriting treasure", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1796899840545340/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-17T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "description": "Thursday, November 17 | 9pm | 18+ | $14 adv./ $16 day of\n\nEl Ten Eleven wsg: Bayonne\n\n\"It\u2019s surprising this record even got made,\u201d bass player and songwriter Kristian Dunn reflects. \u201c[Drummer] Tim\u2019s dad died just before the recording was to begin. Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/619658961515550/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Jonatha Brooke", "description": "New music from a folk icon", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/962264457225114/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Don Henry at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "Grammy Award winner Don Henry's songs have been recorded by legends such as Ray Charles, Patti Page and Conway Twitty; by country crooners including Gene Watson, John Conlee and B.J.

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound. With support from the likes of Diplo, Omarion, and JoJo, plus tours with artists like Chance the Rapper, Flume and Chet Faker, the producer has clearly caught the eye some of a wide variety of tastemakers. Featured by the likes of Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Boiler Room and The FADER, Cuna has also received admiration from music journalists the world over, drawing almost universal praise from disparate outlets. With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory. And that\u2019s part of the reason why Cuna connects with his fan base on such a visceral level, eschewing traditional industry methods for his own unique, intimate manner of going about business.\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/768", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1759418600997980/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-03T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Jeffrey Foucault", "description": "New music!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1063936000310431/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-04T19:30:00-05:00", "name": "Carrie Newcomer", "description": "\"Music that challenges and heals\"\u2014The Third Way", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1702249903360615/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-09T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Chuck Mitchell at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "Chuck Mitchell started singing in Detroit folk clubs in the 1960s. In Toronto, on his first out of town gig, he met Canadian songwriter Joni Anderson.

Mitchell's credits include A Prairie Home Companion and repertory theatre in Texas and in England. He has played Harold Hill in The Music Man and Woody Guthrie in Woody Guthrie's American Song. Most recently, he wrote and produced Mr. Foster & Mr. Twain, in which Stephen Foster joins Mark Twain for an evening of story and song. A Chuck Mitchell's show combines his seasoned skills as an actor, singer and guitarist with a selection of delightful material. He sings cabaret songs by Brecht and Weil -- \"Mack the Knife\" and \"The Bilbao Song\" -- and whimsical songs by Flanders & Swann -- \"The Gnu\" and \"Have Some Madeira, M'dear\". He roves the room singing \"Freeborn Man\" by Ewan McColl, or \"Necessity\" from Finian's Rainbow. He weaves poetry by Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot into his shows.

While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1574155032886638/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-16T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Katie Geddes and Friends at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "Katie Geddes sings traditional and contemporary folk, country-folk, and folk-pop tunes.
