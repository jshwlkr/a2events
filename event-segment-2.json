These techniques provided a source of physical and spiritual strength when devastating illness struck her family. Inspired by the Buddha\u2019s transformational teachings, she set out to learn as much as she could about who he was. By profession a librarian, Shelley immersed herself in research on the time, place, and spiritual traditions that 2500 years ago produced Prince Siddhartha, who became the Buddha. Yoga, in some form, has a role in all of these traditions. While studying yoga\u2019s history, Shelley began her own practice, which proved as transformational as Buddhist meditation.\n\nBecause she loves historical fiction, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha. Unsatisfied with what she found, she decided to write her own. Her research had sparked her curiosity about Yasodhara, the woman who became Siddhartha\u2019s wife, and she became inspired by the personal and spiritual struggles of women who knew him. She began to write the Sadhana trilogy, three novels that tell their stories.\n\nShelley hung up her black belt to practice Iyengar yoga. Both disciplines have enriched her world and the world of her books.\n\n'The Tigress and the Yogi'\n\nA talking tigress...a wandering yogi...\n\nWhen the outcaste girl Mala meets these two, it sets her on a journey from slavery to freedom through an ancient land where chaos threatens gods and mortals alike.

Born in Trim, Co. Meath, to John Keenan, Sr. of Westmeath and the former Mary Bravender of Co. Cavan. The Keenans were a Travelling family steeped in traditional music; both Paddy's father and grandfather were uilleann pipers. Paddy himself took up the pipes at the age of ten, playing his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, when he was 14. He later played with the rest of his family in a group called The Pavees. At 17, having fallen in love with the blues, Paddy left Ireland for England and Europe, where he played blues and rock. Returning to Ireland after a few years, he began playing around Dublin with singer/keyboardist Triona Ni Dhomhnaill and singer/guitarist Micheal O Dhomhnaill. Fiddler Paddy Glackin joined the three, then flute player Matt Molloy, accordionist Tony MacMahon, and guitarist Donal Lunny. Thus was born one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, The Bothy Band. Paddy was one of the band's founding members, and his virtuosity on the pipes combined with the ferocity of his playing made him, in the opinion of many, its driving force. Bothy Band-mate Donal Lunny once described Paddy as \"the Jimi Hendrix of the pipes\".\n\nSince the breakup of The Bothy Band in 1979, Paddy has toured as a soloist, bringing the finest example of traditional Irish music and uilleann piping to audiences around the globe, performing in Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Australia, across Europe, Russia, and of course America.\n\nVisit Paddy on the web here: http://www.paddykeenan.com/", "date": "2016-05-22T17:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/193194074399065/", "name": "Paddy Keenan- In Concert"}, {"description": "Sunday nights the beer flows as we open the stage to local performers.

Davis in support of his most recent book, The Vanishing American Corporation: Navigating the Hazards of a New Economy.\n\nIt may be hard to believe in an era of Walmart, Citizens United, and the Koch brothers, but corporations are on the decline. The number of American companies listed on the stock market dropped by half between 1996 and 2012. In recent years we've seen some of the most storied corporations go bankrupt (General Motors, Chrysler, Eastman Kodak) or disappear entirely (Bethlehem Steel, Lehman Brothers, Borders). Gerald Davis argues this is a root cause of the income inequality and social instability we face today. Corporations were once an integral part of building the middle class. He points out that in their heyday they offered millions of people lifetime employment, a stable career path, health insurance, and retirement pensions. They were like small private welfare states. The businesses that are replacing them will not fill the same role. For one thing, they employ far fewer people\u2014the combined global workforces of Facebook, Yelp, Zynga, LinkedIn, Zillow, Tableau, Zulily, and Box are smaller than the number of people who lost their jobs when Circuit City was liquidated in 2009. And in the \u201csharing economy,\u201d companies have no obligation to most of the people who work for them\u2014at the end of 2014 Uber had over 160,000 \u201cdriver-partners\u201d in the United States but recognized only about 2,000 people as actual employees. Davis tracks the rise of the large American corporation and the economic, social, and technological developments that have led to its decline. The future could see either increasing economic polarization, as careers turn into jobs and jobs turn into tasks, or a more democratic economy built from the grass roots. It's up to us.\n\nGerald F. Davis is the Wilbur K. Pierpont Collegiate Professor of Management at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. He has published widely in management, sociology, and finance. Recent books include Social Movements and Organization Theory (with Doug McAdam, W. Richard Scott, and Mayer N. Zald); Organizations and Organizing (with W. Richard Scott); Managed by the Markets (which won the 2010 Terry Award for best book from the Academy of Management); and Changing your Company from the Inside Out (with Christoper White).

Hinton\u2019s research focuses on the persistence of poverty and racial inequality in the 20th century United States. In her new book, From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America (Harvard University Press), Hinton examines the implementation of federal law enforcement programs beginning in the mid-1960s that laid the groundwork for the mass incarceration of American citizens. In revealing the links between the rise of the American carceral state and earlier anti-poverty programs, Hinton presents Ronald Reagan\u2019s War on Drugs not as a sharp policy departure but rather as the full realization of a shift towards surveillance and confinement that began during the Johnson administration. Before joining the Harvard faculty, Hinton spent two years as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Michigan Society of Fellows and Assistant Professor in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan.

Sweeney in support of his most recent title, The Enthusiast: How the Best Friend of Francis of Assisi Almost Destroyed What He Started.\n\nPopular historian and award-winning author Jon M. Sweeney relates the untold story of St. Francis\u2019s friendship with Elias of Cortona, the man who helped him build the Franciscan movement. Sweeney uses the complexities of their relationship in a gripping narrative of how their efforts changed the world and how Elias\u2019s enthusiasm betrayed the ideals of his friend.\n\nBlending history and biography, Sweeney reveals how Francis and Elias rebuilt churches, aided lepers, and entertained as \u201cGod\u2019s troubadours\u201d to the delight of everyday people who had grown tired of a remote and tumultuous Church. At the height of their spiritual renaissance, however, Elias became \u201cthe devil\u201d to many of the other friars; they believed him to be a traitor to their ideals. After Francis\u2019s premature death, the movement fractured. Scorned by most of the Franciscan leadership, Elias followed a path that would leave him a lonely, broken man. Sweeney shows how Elias\u2019s undoing was rooted in his attempts to honor his old friend.\n\nJon M. Sweeney is an independent scholar and one of religion\u2019s most respected writers. His work has been hailed by everyone from PBS and James Martin, S.J., to Fox News and Dan Savage. He\u2019s been interviewed on CBS Saturday Morning, Fox News, CBS-TV Chicago, Religion and Ethics Newsweekly, and on the popular program Chicago Tonight. Several of his books have become Book-of-the-Month Club and Quality Paperback Book Club selections. His popular medieval history, The Pope Who Quit, was published by Image/Random House and optioned by HBO. It was a selection of the History Book Club and received a starred review in Booklist. His book, When Saint Francis Saved the Church, received a 2015 award for excellence in history from the Catholic Press Association. His other words include Inventing Hell, The Complete Francis of Assisi, and The St. Francis Prayer Book. Sweeney writes regularly for America and The Tablet, and is also the editorial director at Franciscan Media. He is married, the father of three, and lives in Vermont.\nEvent date: \nWednesday, June 1, 2016 - 7:00pm", "date": "2016-06-01T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/274191096260542/", "name": "Jon M.

A wave of mysterious crimes had police baffled: bodies dumped along roadsides, suspicious suicides, bombings of homes and halls, flogging victims who refused to speak, assassination plots.

How, Claudia wonders, will she fit into this new fatherless world with the old one still going on around her?\n \nInvincible Summers follows Claudia through eleven summers, from the age of six through twenty-three, as she adjusts with varying degrees of success to what it means to be a daughter, a sister, friend, and lover in a world of loss, betrayal and bad judgment.\n \nSet in a middle class suburb outside of Detroit in the 1960s and 1970s, the novel shows Claudia\u2019s pursuit to find a purpose as she struggles with feelings of rootlessness in a world torn apart by assassinations, riots, and the Vietnam War. It is a coming-of-age story of one woman\u2019s journey through the guilt and responsibility she feels for her father\u2019s death, her mother\u2019s career-altering disfiguration, and her brother\u2019s downslide into drugs.\n \nInvincible Summers weaves a tale about grief and forgiveness and the indelible heartbreak of all the things left unsaid.", "date": "2016-06-09T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/822560807877847/", "name": "EVENT CANCELED TO BE RESCHEDULED LATER -Meet Michigan Author Robin Gaines for a Discussion & Signing of 'Invincible Summers'"}, {"description": "Shutta Crum writes picture books for children, novels for teens and poetry for adults.

Varying in strength, form, and duration, light constructs architecture as a situational experience rather than a fixed space. Newell\u2019s fascination with light is a fascination with darkness.

When we regard a single image it may convey some meaning, but the moment we place another image next to it--even a very different one--our minds begin to construct narrative between those two images. Most of the narrative found in comics happens in the reader\u2019s mind, prompted by deft choices made by the cartoonist author.\n\nHOW MIGHT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMICS CHANGE IF WE WERE MORE AWARE OF THE THINKING WE\u2019RE DOING WHEN READING THEM?\n\nComics Unbound explores how cartoonists use shape, size, line, color, and context to activate the readers\u2019 imaginations and invite them into the partnership of comics narrative. Pages are removed from their intended context, that of the graphic novel or comic book, and re-contextualized with the materials that went into making the final pages. Sketches, notes, scripts, and tools are displayed alongside the final artwork. This new context reveals what is usually an invisible narrative in comics--the journey from artist\u2019s vision to clear transmission of meaning.\n\nThe exhibition runs June 10 to June 25 (the opening reception is June 17)\n\nThis exhibition contains pieces by cartoonists appearing at the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival held at the Ann Arbor District Library June 18 and 19, 2016.\n\nCURATOR BIOS:\n\nJerzy Drozd is one of the artists of The Warren Commission Report. He leads cartooning classes for children, teens, and adults, as well as for teachers who want to bring comics to the classroom. He co-founded the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival and serves as the event\u2019s programming coordinator. Drozd wrote and drew the graphic novel The Front, has worked on Antarctic Press\u2019s Ninja High School and PPV: Pay- Per-View, and has drawn special projects for Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, Marvel Comics, VIZ Media, and others.\n\nAnne Drozd is a librarian and artist. She and her husband Jerzy created Tiny Astronaut Press, to create many space-themed art works, including Rocketosaurus, a fanciful comic for young readers about an Apollo crew. As a librarian at the Ann Arbor District Library, she develops arts programming and has drawn instructional comics for the science tools collection.

Now, he issues the sharpest entry of his vision, the majestic The Blackberry Train engineered by Steve Albini (Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been an evolution,\u201d James says. \u201cThis set of songs definitely has a harder edge, but it\u2019s a continuation of the last album. The main thing for me is to not conform or compromise.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 panoramic artistry is inspired by such diverse musicians as Kurt Cobain, The Smiths, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, The Cure, The Beatles, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, and Hank Williams. His fingerprint aesthetic has earned him plaudits from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Daily News. He\u2019s earned a strong following the old fashioned way, through tirelessly touring the US, Europe and the UK, and playing bigger and bigger shows with each go around.\n\nThe Blackberry Train is an epiphanic co-mingling of aesthetics. James sought out the distinct audio stylings of Steve Albini to conjure a grungier sensibility. He welcomed the engineer\u2019s gifts for capturing music with a raw clarity, and Steve Albini\u2019s reputation for not impinging on an artist\u2019s vision. The results make for an eclectic album with fastidiously crafted songs documented in the studio with glorious purity.\n\n\u201cI like the music to have elements of the avant garde, psychedelic, and be just a little against the grain,\u201d James reveals. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about having as much emotion as possible for me, musically and lyrically. It\u2019s all about the music being cathartic, heartfelt and true.\u201d\n\nThe Blackberry Train manages to be both diverse and cohesive. The album opens invigoratingly with the jangling rocker, \u201cToo Hard\u201d and closes with the stately and aptly named folk song \u201cPeace and Stillness.\u201d Between these bookends, highlights include the rough-edged and urgently melodic \u201cUnicorn,\u201d the anthemic \u201cPeyote Coyote,\u201d and the soulful ballad \u201cPrayer.\u201d One very personal song is the winsome and reflective \u201cWaterfall\u201d which was inspired by memories of his mother.\n\nThis summer and fall James will embark on extensive tour dates in the U.S. Thinking ahead, James says: \u201cI just want to keep on going, keep working, and improving as a songwriter. I\u2019d love to feel that I realized my full potential both as a person, and as a songwriter. That feels like a great, fulfilling goal to shoot for.

Originally named Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. with typical irreverence, the duo of Joshua Epstein (also of the Silent Years) and Daniel Zott came together in Detroit in 2009. Working out of a basement studio, the pair worked to create a sound that was danceable without sacrificing anything in the songwriting department, merging intricate and airy melodies with solid programmed beats and synth atmospherics.\nTheir hard work bore fruit in 2010 when they released their debut EP, Horse Power, on Quite Scientific, quickly followed by the EP My Love Is Easy: Remixes Pt. 1. That same year, the pair was also tapped to do a remix of Moby's \"Wait for Me.\" The resulting buzz from their early releases led to a record deal with Warner Bros., who released their Record Store Day-exclusive EP titled We Almost Lost Detroit in spring 2011. The duo's full-length debut, It's a Corporate World, followed that summer. In 2013, they returned with an EP, Patterns, before releasing their sophomore full-length, The Speed of Things, later that year. \nIn 2015, even though they had the blessing of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. himself, to avoid ongoing confusion by fans and seekers of the race car driver, Epstein and Zott decided to change the band's name to simply JR JR.

From their opening song to the finale of their set, the Ben Daniels Band cuts through with their originality, musicianship, and a sound that spans Americana, Blues, Jazz, and Rock.\nThroughout years of touring, BDB has played numerous venues in Michigan, New York City, Washington D.C., and Nashville . As a solo artist, Ben has stepped on the stage in Austin, TX at the Cactus Cafe, as well as The Barns at Wolf Trap. The son of actor Jeff Daniels, he has quietly monitored what it takes to live life as an artist. Beyond a passed down talent, the Ben Daniels Band believes in hard work, perseverance, and creatively challenging themselves and their audience.\nWith George Merkel on guitar, Tommy Reifel on bass, Wesley Fritzemeier on drums/mandolin, and Amanda Merte on percussion/vocals, BDB\u2019s live show never fails to take over the venue. With five CDs under their belts - Coming From The C, Checkin\u2019 In To The Michigan Inn, Can't You See, The Mountain Home EP, and their dual album & movie release Old Gold - the Ben Daniels Band is has grown to be a formidable group that sounds pleasantly familiar, yet unforgettably unique.\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

If Raymie can win the Little Miss Central Florida Tire competition, then her father, who left town two days ago with a dental hygienist, will see Raymie's picture in the paper and (maybe) come home. To win, not only does Raymie have to do good deeds and learn how to twirl a baton; she also has to contend with the wispy, frequently fainting Louisiana Elefante, who has a show-business background, and the fiery, stubborn Beverly Tapinski, who's determined to sabotage the contest.

Just as much influenced by classic rock & roll, country, Latin and Southern hip hop as they are the Stax/Volt or Muscle Shoals era, The Suffers are bringing a fresh approach to what they have coined Gulf Coast Soul. Late night legend David Letterman proclaimed in early 2015 \"If you cant do this, get out of the business\", let it be known that The Suffers are here to stay! With a year that included performances for NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, Newport Folk Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival and The Late Show, The Suffers have delivered over 150 stirring performances of their signature 3rd Coast Soul sound to thousands of new and old fans alike. The large ensemble packs each position of the rhythm and horn section with a level of talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin's massive voice. The band's sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. Their 2016 self-titled debut album is set to hit shelves on February 12th and will be the continuation of what 2015's Make Some Room EP started. Expect to see the band\u2019s name continue to climb up the tier on posters of the best festivals around!\nhttp://www.thesuffers.com\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

In 2006, Dennen signed with Dualtone and released So Much More. Hope for the Hopeless followed on the same imprint in 2008. Dennen's fourth studio effort, Loverboy, which featured subtle African rhythms and more of a pop veneer, arrived in April of 2011, followed in 2013 by the sparser acoustic-based Smoke and Mirrors and 2014 \nrelease of Out of My Head.

The band\u2019s music \u2014 a genre-bending hybrid of indie-pop melodies, global rhythms and songwriting styles influenced from all over the world \u2014 was as broad as their audience, which stretched from the group\u2019s hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to the shores of Osaka, Japan (where they scored a Number One pop hot with the song \u201cBook of Matches\u201d). Show by show, in venues ranging from rock clubs and performing arts centers to festivals encompassing everything from bluegrass to electronica, The Ragbirds developed a well-deserved reputation as one of the most dynamic, high-spirited live bands in roots music.\nThe Ragbirds albums have received local and national praise, hailed \u201cHighly impressive!\u201d by USA Today and touted as \u201cAstounding international eclecticism\u201d by Reveal Arts.  The band has performed in over forty-five states to a tune of 150+ shows a year, The Ragbirds have become festival favorites.  They have won over crowds at  Electric Forest, 10,000 Lakes, CMJ Music Marathon, Summer Camp, Wheatland, Blissfest, Wookiefoot\u2019s Harvest Fest,  Ann Arbor Folk Festival, Hookahville, to name a few; and have shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Rusted Root, Matisyahu, Railroad Earth, John Butler Trio,  Toubab Krewe,  Cornmeal, Greensky Bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum,  Jeff Daniels, The Everyone Orchestra, The Duhks, and many others.For all their traveling, The Ragbirds maintain a steady connection to their home base.  While reflecting on Michigan, Erin had this to say \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a beautiful place to be, snuggled in the Great Lakes, close enough to hold hands with Canada. It is connected to a secret, mysterious, magical place called the U.P., but most of all there is an amazingly talented and humbly supportive music community that spreads through the state, clustered into groups in Ann Arbor and Lansing, Grand Rapids, Flint, Traverse City and Detroit.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, its no wonder why they are headlining festivals and one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album \u201cTerra Incognita \u201c goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments, and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

It\u2019s as gripping as it is charming\u2014and with grand flourish, be awestuck as he exits the tent on his high wire, crossing above at 150 feet \u201cand into the sky.\u201d\n\nPlease note: Tickets must be purchased in advance, circus tent is air conditioned, wheelchair accessible and capacity is limited.\n\nThis performance is generously underwritten by Ellie Serras.\nSponsored by: Toyota USA\nPresented in part with support from: National Endowment for the Arts\nMedia Partner: Michigan Radio 91.7\n\nWatch video: https://youtu.be/TB0Oyl1gSNk", "date": "2016-08-28T18:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1556374641333780/", "name": "One-Man Circus (L\u2019homme Cirque)"}, {"description": "We've got a whole bunch of drama camps for kids this summer! \n\nFor ages 5-9, 9:00 am - noon:\n   - Outer Space: June 27-July 1\n   - Music and Movement: July 5-8\n   - Art and Stories: July 11-15\n   - Under the Sea: August 1-5\n   - Nature: August 8-12\n   - Magical Creatures: August 15-19\n$150 before June 1; $170 after June 1\n\nFor ages 10-13, 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm:\n   - Pointless Playmaking: July 18-21 & July 25-28  \n$160 before June 1; $180 after June 1\n\nEnroll for 2 or more class and get $10 off each!", "date": "2016-09-01T09:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/214510118917962/", "name": "Summer Drama Camps"}, {"description": "Roots and blues music from New Orleans and Michigan", "date": "2016-09-06T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1085671918167396/", "name": "Luke Winslow-King"}, {"description": "\"Bluegrass superstars\"\u2014New York Times", "date": "2016-09-09T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/599281333571784/", "name": "The Gibson Brothers"}, {"description": "There are songs that transport you to good times remembered.

That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray.

September 24 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nThe Slackers are self styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll from New York City. The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "date": "2016-09-24T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Where song, spirit, and speaking meet.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "Save these dates to head over to beautiful Buhr Park (unless noted otherwise) and see fast paced, full contact roller derby action from your local league, Ann Arbor Derby Dimes!\n\nMay 14 - June 11 - July 9 - August 6\n\nBUY 2016 SEASON PASSES: http://bpt.me/2537986\n\nMay 14\nBrawlstars vs The Chicago Outfit: Syndicate\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs East Lansing Roller Derby: Broadbarians\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/1reSK5y\nBUY MAY 14 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2537998\n\nJune 11\nBrawlstars vs North Star Roller Girls: Supernovas\nArbor Bruising Co. vs North Star Roller Girls: Northern Lights\nBUY JUNE 11 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2538000\n\nJuly 9\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Border City Brawlers: All-Stars\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Border City Brawlers: Canadian Clubbers\nBUY JULY 9 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539693\n\nAugust 6\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Flint City Derby Girls\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Killamazoo Derby Darlins: Kill Squad\nBUY AUGUST 6 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539697\n\nFor more information, see our 2016 season schedule: http://a2derbydimes.org/2016-schedule", "date": "2016-10-14T17:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/192972824428594/", "name": "Ann Arbor Derby Dimes 2016 season"}, {"description": "lauriemcclain.com", "date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197527007266742/", "name": "Laurie McLain at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "Two nights with Steppin' in It's fast-rising lead vocalist", "date": "2016-10-21T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1668844700041158/", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 1"}, {"date": "2016-10-22T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/215744518775574/", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 2"}, {"description": "Michigan's bluegrass and Americana success story", "date": "2016-10-23T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1696673723915750/", "name": "Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys"}, {"description": "Tue.

His groove-oriented strumming and fingerpicking draw on influences from the mountains of western North Carolina where he now lives, and from lots of different good old traditional folk stuff of all kinds.
