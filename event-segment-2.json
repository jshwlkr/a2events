Following her first Wheatland Festival in 2012, Mainville fell in love with the idea of performing her own songs on stage, which eventually inspired her 2014 gypsy swing and baroque pop debut EP, Full Steam Ahead.\n\n        Since the release of her first solo output, Olivia has forged a unique path within the Mitten scene, becoming known alongside her band, the Aquatic Troupe, for their energized, dynamic performances and their gargantuan musical talent.

Comprised of consummate young talents Mainville, Andy Fettig, Bleu Quick, Libby DeCamp, and Ian Burke\u2014 and with a special guest appearance by none other than David Bowie\u2019s bandleader and lead guitarist, Gerry Leonard \u2014their multifarious, enthusiastic delivery is sure to be a hit with listeners everywhere.\n\n        Throughout her career as a professional performing musician thus far, Olivia has toured with notable folk band Caravan of Thieves, and has collaborated with stellar Michigan artists like the Ragbirds, the Appleseed Collective, the Accidentals, and Jack and the Bear. She\u2019s also made appearances at significant festivals and venues throughout the Mitten, such as Blissfest in Harbor Springs, the Majestic in Detroit, and the Ark in Ann Arbor. Between Olivia and her band mates, the Aquatic Troupe is capable of playing 11 instruments, ranging from guitar and violin to the trumpet, accordion, and omnichord \u2013 all of which encompass their collective sound.\n\n \u201cI really love that we\u2019re growing as a band,\u201d says Olivia. \u201cWe are always exploring new styles and inviting other musicians into our live shows to lend their talents and expand our sound.

Her work has appeared in Guernica, The Prague Review, The Offing, The Rumpus, and been nominated for a Pushcart Prize. She worked in magazines, politics, and public relations in the U.K and her native New Zealand before moving to the U.S. She holds an MFA from Columbia College Chicago. In her debut essay collection, New Zealand native Toni Nealie examines journeys, homelands, family, and motherhood. She details humiliating confrontations with airport security, muses on the color brown, and intimately investigates her grandfather\u2019s complicated and criminal past, all while hearkening home\u2014wherever and whatever that is.\n\nZoe Zolbrod's work has appeared in Salon, The Nervous Breakdown, The Weeklings, and The Rumpus, where she serves as Sunday co-editor. Her debut novel Currency won a 2010 Nobbie Award and received an honorable mention by Friends of American Writers. Zolbrod lives in Evanston, Illinois, with her husband and children. About The Telling: Zoe Zolbrod remained silent about her early childhood molestation for nearly a decade. When she finally decided to tell, she wasn't sure what to expect, or what to say. Through a kaleidoscopic series of experiences as an adult, mother, and feminist, Zolbrod traces the development of her sexuality and her relationships with men in the shadow of her sexual abuse.", "date": "2016-05-16T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1094016970640442/", "name": "Toni Nealie & Zoe Zolbrod"}, {"description": "Free and open to the public, books will be on sale at the event courtesy of Nicola\u2019s Books and a book signing will follow.\n\nLesley Stahl will discuss her new book \u201cBecoming Grandma: The Joys and Science of the New Grandparenting.\u201d After four decades as a reporter, Lesley Stahl\u2019s most vivid and transformative experience of her life was not covering the White House, interviewing heads of state, or researching stories at 60 Minutes.

Liebler, and Thomas Lynch for a discussion of Bob Seger's House and Other Stories, recently published by the Made in Michigan Writers Series.\n\nBob Seger\u2019s House and Other Stories is a collection of short stories written by some of Michigan\u2019s most well-known fiction writers. This collection of twenty-two short stories serves as a celebration not only of the tenth anniversary of the Made in Michigan Writers Series in 2016 but also of the rich history of writing and storytelling in the region. As series editors Michael Delp and M. L. Leibler state in their preface, \"The stories contained in this anthology are a way to stay connected to each other. Think of them as messages sent from all over the map, stitching readers and writers together through stories that continue to honor the ancient art of the fire tale, the hunting epic, and all of the ways language feeds the blood of imagination.\"\n\nThe scope of this project reflects the dynamic and diverse writing that is currently taking place by people who consider their home to be the Great Lakes state. Stories are far-ranging, from the streets of Detroit and the iconic presence of the auto industry to the wild tracts of the Upper Peninsula, to a couple on the west coast trying to figure out parenting. The book vibrates with that tension, of metal versus rock and human frailty taking on the pitfalls and hardships of living in this world.\n\nIn his foreword, Charles Baxter asks, \"Does a region give rise to a particular kind of literature? Michigan is so fiercely diverse in its landscapes, its economy, and its population demographics that it presents anybody who wants to write about it with a kind of blank slate. You can\u2019t summarize the state easily.\" These storytellers exude a \"Michigan aesthetic\" in their writing, something that cannot be learned in a textbook or taught in a classroom but can be felt through the tales of these storytellers.\n\nThe experience of picking up this collection is akin to taking a drive from the mechanized world and arriving several hours later in one of the wildest places on earth. Readers of short fiction will enjoy the multitude of voices in this anthology.\n\nEvent date: \nFriday, May 20, 2016 - 7:00pm", "date": "2016-05-20T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1602099290105979/", "name": "Fiction at Literati: A Made In Michigan Discussion"}, {"description": "In memory of Arbor Opera Theater\u2019s first artistic director, we are pleased to announce the creation of the JAMES K.

These techniques provided a source of physical and spiritual strength when devastating illness struck her family. Inspired by the Buddha\u2019s transformational teachings, she set out to learn as much as she could about who he was. By profession a librarian, Shelley immersed herself in research on the time, place, and spiritual traditions that 2500 years ago produced Prince Siddhartha, who became the Buddha. Yoga, in some form, has a role in all of these traditions. While studying yoga\u2019s history, Shelley began her own practice, which proved as transformational as Buddhist meditation.\n\nBecause she loves historical fiction, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha. Unsatisfied with what she found, she decided to write her own. Her research had sparked her curiosity about Yasodhara, the woman who became Siddhartha\u2019s wife, and she became inspired by the personal and spiritual struggles of women who knew him. She began to write the Sadhana trilogy, three novels that tell their stories.\n\nShelley hung up her black belt to practice Iyengar yoga. Both disciplines have enriched her world and the world of her books.\n\n'The Tigress and the Yogi'\n\nA talking tigress...a wandering yogi...\n\nWhen the outcaste girl Mala meets these two, it sets her on a journey from slavery to freedom through an ancient land where chaos threatens gods and mortals alike.

Born in Trim, Co. Meath, to John Keenan, Sr. of Westmeath and the former Mary Bravender of Co. Cavan. The Keenans were a Travelling family steeped in traditional music; both Paddy's father and grandfather were uilleann pipers. Paddy himself took up the pipes at the age of ten, playing his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, when he was 14. He later played with the rest of his family in a group called The Pavees. At 17, having fallen in love with the blues, Paddy left Ireland for England and Europe, where he played blues and rock. Returning to Ireland after a few years, he began playing around Dublin with singer/keyboardist Triona Ni Dhomhnaill and singer/guitarist Micheal O Dhomhnaill. Fiddler Paddy Glackin joined the three, then flute player Matt Molloy, accordionist Tony MacMahon, and guitarist Donal Lunny. Thus was born one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, The Bothy Band. Paddy was one of the band's founding members, and his virtuosity on the pipes combined with the ferocity of his playing made him, in the opinion of many, its driving force. Bothy Band-mate Donal Lunny once described Paddy as \"the Jimi Hendrix of the pipes\".\n\nSince the breakup of The Bothy Band in 1979, Paddy has toured as a soloist, bringing the finest example of traditional Irish music and uilleann piping to audiences around the globe, performing in Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Australia, across Europe, Russia, and of course America.\n\nVisit Paddy on the web here: http://www.paddykeenan.com/", "date": "2016-05-22T17:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/193194074399065/", "name": "Paddy Keenan- In Concert"}, {"description": "Sunday nights the beer flows as we open the stage to local performers.

A wave of mysterious crimes had police baffled: bodies dumped along roadsides, suspicious suicides, bombings of homes and halls, flogging victims who refused to speak, assassination plots.

Her short stories and essays can be found in Slice, Crack the Spine, Spindrift, Oasis: A Literary Magazine, Willard & Maple, The Homestead Review, Current Magazine, and Porcupine Literary Arts Magazine.\n\nInvincible Summers was a semi-finalist for The Iowa Short Fiction & John Simmons Short Fiction Award for 2014. She received her MA in journalism from Michigan State University and worked as a research intern at Rolling Stone while freelancing for various music publications. Robin\u2019s interviewed or reviewed acts as diverse as Peter, Paul and Mary to Alice in Chains. Music, or the business of music, finds its way into much of her fiction.\n\n'Invincible Summers' \nAfter returning home from burying her father on Independence Day, ten-year-old Claudia Goodwin watches from the kitchen window as neighbors drag picnic tables and coolers into the middle of the street to celebrate the holiday. How, Claudia wonders, will she fit into this new fatherless world with the old one still going on around her?\n \nInvincible Summers follows Claudia through eleven summers, from the age of six through twenty-three, as she adjusts with varying degrees of success to what it means to be a daughter, a sister, friend, and lover in a world of loss, betrayal and bad judgment.\n \nSet in a middle class suburb outside of Detroit in the 1960s and 1970s, the novel shows Claudia\u2019s pursuit to find a purpose as she struggles with feelings of rootlessness in a world torn apart by assassinations, riots, and the Vietnam War. It is a coming-of-age story of one woman\u2019s journey through the guilt and responsibility she feels for her father\u2019s death, her mother\u2019s career-altering disfiguration, and her brother\u2019s downslide into drugs.\n \nInvincible Summers weaves a tale about grief and forgiveness and the indelible heartbreak of all the things left unsaid.", "date": "2016-06-09T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/822560807877847/", "name": "Meet Michigan Author Robin Gaines for a Discussion & Signing of 'Invincible Summers'"}, {"description": "http://cafegive.com/make_the_match/boaa-volunteermatch\nWe believe everyone should have the chance to make a difference.

After terrifying hours in the Superdome they board a bus for the Houston Astrodome along with other victims of Hurricane Katrina, including a man named Harold, who Essence strongly suspects is her long-lost father.\n\nAfter Grace is suspended from St. Catherine\u2019s for her disobedient behavior, she accompanies her father, a psychologist, to the Astrodome to help with the evacuees.\n\nSo Grace begins her essay for English class, her attempt to describe her day with the pitiful Katrina victims.

Examples abound: James Watson and Francis Crick formed a legendary partnership that led to the discovery of DNA, but they essentially ignored the contribution of female colleague Rosalind Franklin. Later, in the race to sequence the human genome, Watson criticized J. Craig Venter's technique as a process that could be run by monkeys.

The Allen Creek Greenway Master Plan process will explore improvement options that balance the needs and desires of a variety of users and considers the significant resources within the study area.  To develop this plan, City of Ann Arbor staff recommended a planning process to engage stakeholders, community leaders and residents in shaping the scope, content and direction of the master plan.

When we regard a single image it may convey some meaning, but the moment we place another image next to it--even a very different one--our minds begin to construct narrative between those two images. Most of the narrative found in comics happens in the reader\u2019s mind, prompted by deft choices made by the cartoonist author.\n\nHOW MIGHT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMICS CHANGE IF WE WERE MORE AWARE OF THE THINKING WE\u2019RE DOING WHEN READING THEM?\n\nComics Unbound explores how cartoonists use shape, size, line, color, and context to activate the readers\u2019 imaginations and invite them into the partnership of comics narrative. Pages are removed from their intended context, that of the graphic novel or comic book, and re-contextualized with the materials that went into making the final pages. Sketches, notes, scripts, and tools are displayed alongside the final artwork. This new context reveals what is usually an invisible narrative in comics--the journey from artist\u2019s vision to clear transmission of meaning.\n\nThe exhibition runs June 10 to June 25 (the opening reception is June 17)\n\nThis exhibition contains pieces by cartoonists appearing at the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival held at the Ann Arbor District Library June 18 and 19, 2016.\n\nCURATOR BIOS:\n\nJerzy Drozd is one of the artists of The Warren Commission Report. He leads cartooning classes for children, teens, and adults, as well as for teachers who want to bring comics to the classroom. He co-founded the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival and serves as the event\u2019s programming coordinator. Drozd wrote and drew the graphic novel The Front, has worked on Antarctic Press\u2019s Ninja High School and PPV: Pay- Per-View, and has drawn special projects for Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, Marvel Comics, VIZ Media, and others.\n\nAnne Drozd is a librarian and artist. She and her husband Jerzy created Tiny Astronaut Press, to create many space-themed art works, including Rocketosaurus, a fanciful comic for young readers about an Apollo crew. As a librarian at the Ann Arbor District Library, she develops arts programming and has drawn instructional comics for the science tools collection.

Now, he issues the sharpest entry of his vision, the majestic The Blackberry Train engineered by Steve Albini (Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been an evolution,\u201d James says. \u201cThis set of songs definitely has a harder edge, but it\u2019s a continuation of the last album. The main thing for me is to not conform or compromise.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 panoramic artistry is inspired by such diverse musicians as Kurt Cobain, The Smiths, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, The Cure, The Beatles, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, and Hank Williams. His fingerprint aesthetic has earned him plaudits from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Daily News. He\u2019s earned a strong following the old fashioned way, through tirelessly touring the US, Europe and the UK, and playing bigger and bigger shows with each go around.\n\nThe Blackberry Train is an epiphanic co-mingling of aesthetics. James sought out the distinct audio stylings of Steve Albini to conjure a grungier sensibility. He welcomed the engineer\u2019s gifts for capturing music with a raw clarity, and Steve Albini\u2019s reputation for not impinging on an artist\u2019s vision. The results make for an eclectic album with fastidiously crafted songs documented in the studio with glorious purity.\n\n\u201cI like the music to have elements of the avant garde, psychedelic, and be just a little against the grain,\u201d James reveals. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about having as much emotion as possible for me, musically and lyrically. It\u2019s all about the music being cathartic, heartfelt and true.\u201d\n\nThe Blackberry Train manages to be both diverse and cohesive. The album opens invigoratingly with the jangling rocker, \u201cToo Hard\u201d and closes with the stately and aptly named folk song \u201cPeace and Stillness.\u201d Between these bookends, highlights include the rough-edged and urgently melodic \u201cUnicorn,\u201d the anthemic \u201cPeyote Coyote,\u201d and the soulful ballad \u201cPrayer.\u201d One very personal song is the winsome and reflective \u201cWaterfall\u201d which was inspired by memories of his mother.\n\nThis summer and fall James will embark on extensive tour dates in the U.S. Thinking ahead, James says: \u201cI just want to keep on going, keep working, and improving as a songwriter. I\u2019d love to feel that I realized my full potential both as a person, and as a songwriter. That feels like a great, fulfilling goal to shoot for. Making a lot of music, and striving for more depth artistically\u2013those are my goals.\u201d", "date": "2016-06-20T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1689584001315124/", "name": "James McCartney 6/20/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Capturing an irresistibly bright and uplifting sound, musical pioneer and humanitarian Michael Franti and Spearhead's globally conscious reggae pop anthems are spreading some much appreciated positivity worldwide.

Originally named Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. with typical irreverence, the duo of Joshua Epstein (also of the Silent Years) and Daniel Zott came together in Detroit in 2009. Working out of a basement studio, the pair worked to create a sound that was danceable without sacrificing anything in the songwriting department, merging intricate and airy melodies with solid programmed beats and synth atmospherics.\nTheir hard work bore fruit in 2010 when they released their debut EP, Horse Power, on Quite Scientific, quickly followed by the EP My Love Is Easy: Remixes Pt. 1. That same year, the pair was also tapped to do a remix of Moby's \"Wait for Me.\" The resulting buzz from their early releases led to a record deal with Warner Bros., who released their Record Store Day-exclusive EP titled We Almost Lost Detroit in spring 2011. The duo's full-length debut, It's a Corporate World, followed that summer. In 2013, they returned with an EP, Patterns, before releasing their sophomore full-length, The Speed of Things, later that year. \nIn 2015, even though they had the blessing of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. himself, to avoid ongoing confusion by fans and seekers of the race car driver, Epstein and Zott decided to change the band's name to simply JR JR.

Just as much influenced by classic rock & roll, country, Latin and Southern hip hop as they are the Stax/Volt or Muscle Shoals era, The Suffers are bringing a fresh approach to what they have coined Gulf Coast Soul. Late night legend David Letterman proclaimed in early 2015 \"If you cant do this, get out of the business\", let it be known that The Suffers are here to stay! With a year that included performances for NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, Newport Folk Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival and The Late Show, The Suffers have delivered over 150 stirring performances of their signature 3rd Coast Soul sound to thousands of new and old fans alike. The large ensemble packs each position of the rhythm and horn section with a level of talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin's massive voice. The band's sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. Their 2016 self-titled debut album is set to hit shelves on February 12th and will be the continuation of what 2015's Make Some Room EP started.

In 2006, Dennen signed with Dualtone and released So Much More. Hope for the Hopeless followed on the same imprint in 2008. Dennen's fourth studio effort, Loverboy, which featured subtle African rhythms and more of a pop veneer, arrived in April of 2011, followed in 2013 by the sparser acoustic-based Smoke and Mirrors and 2014 \nrelease of Out of My Head.

Their collective playlist you won\u2019t find on mainstream radio\nIn 2015, the band won Traverse Magazine\u2019s \u201cRed Hot Best\u201d of Northern Michigan Music for their third year in a row, The Emerging Artists Series at Summerfest hey were named one of the top seven breakout artists at SXSW 2015 by Billboard Magazine.

The band\u2019s music \u2014 a genre-bending hybrid of indie-pop melodies, global rhythms and songwriting styles influenced from all over the world \u2014 was as broad as their audience, which stretched from the group\u2019s hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to the shores of Osaka, Japan (where they scored a Number One pop hot with the song \u201cBook of Matches\u201d). Show by show, in venues ranging from rock clubs and performing arts centers to festivals encompassing everything from bluegrass to electronica, The Ragbirds developed a well-deserved reputation as one of the most dynamic, high-spirited live bands in roots music.\nThe Ragbirds albums have received local and national praise, hailed \u201cHighly impressive!\u201d by USA Today and touted as \u201cAstounding international eclecticism\u201d by Reveal Arts.  The band has performed in over forty-five states to a tune of 150+ shows a year, The Ragbirds have become festival favorites.  They have won over crowds at  Electric Forest, 10,000 Lakes, CMJ Music Marathon, Summer Camp, Wheatland, Blissfest, Wookiefoot\u2019s Harvest Fest,  Ann Arbor Folk Festival, Hookahville, to name a few; and have shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Rusted Root, Matisyahu, Railroad Earth, John Butler Trio,  Toubab Krewe,  Cornmeal, Greensky Bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum,  Jeff Daniels, The Everyone Orchestra, The Duhks, and many others.For all their traveling, The Ragbirds maintain a steady connection to their home base.  While reflecting on Michigan, Erin had this to say \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a beautiful place to be, snuggled in the Great Lakes, close enough to hold hands with Canada. It is connected to a secret, mysterious, magical place called the U.P., but most of all there is an amazingly talented and humbly supportive music community that spreads through the state, clustered into groups in Ann Arbor and Lansing, Grand Rapids, Flint, Traverse City and Detroit.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, its no wonder why they are headlining festivals and one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album \u201cTerra Incognita \u201c goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments, and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

These songs and numerous others have made John Ford Coley a singing legend.\nJohn is most revered as half of the duo England Dan and John Ford Coley. The classically-trained pianist and talented guitarist continues performing the gold and platinum record hits for audiences around the world. Some of Coley\u2019s other hits are, \u201cGone Too Far,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again,\u201d and, \u201cSad To Belong.\"\nJohn\u2019s experiences comprise a broad background. Although he performed throughout high school and college as a classical and rock pianist, he chose to major in English Literature in college, and is an avid student of history. In the mid-1980\u2019s, John began acting in television and in feature films. He recently penned a book, \"Backstage Pass,\" about his years in the music industry.\nwww.johnfordcoley.com", "date": "2016-09-09T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1675656812706888/", "name": "John Ford Coley at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "Save these dates to head over to beautiful Buhr Park (unless noted otherwise) and see fast paced, full contact roller derby action from your local league, Ann Arbor Derby Dimes!\n\nMay 14 - June 11 - July 9 - August 6\n\nBUY 2016 SEASON PASSES: http://bpt.me/2537986\n\nMay 14\nBrawlstars vs The Chicago Outfit: Syndicate\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs East Lansing Roller Derby: Broadbarians\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/1reSK5y\nBUY MAY 14 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2537998\n\nJune 11\nBrawlstars vs North Star Roller Girls: Supernovas\nArbor Bruising Co. vs North Star Roller Girls: Northern Lights\nBUY JUNE 11 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2538000\n\nJuly 9\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Border City Brawlers: All-Stars\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Border City Brawlers: Canadian Clubbers\nBUY JULY 9 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539693\n\nAugust 6\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Flint City Derby Girls\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Killamazoo Derby Darlins: Kill Squad\nBUY AUGUST 6 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539697\n\nFor more information, see our 2016 season schedule: http://a2derbydimes.org/2016-schedule", "date": "2016-09-11T17:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/192972824428594/", "name": "Ann Arbor Derby Dimes 2016 season"}, {"description": "Ireland's legends push musical boundaries", "date": "2016-09-15T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/905763186211716/", "name": "Altan"}, {"description": "The Free Speech (While Supplies Last) tour", "date": "2016-09-16T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1275355069146738/", "name": "Second City\u2014Night 1"}, {"description": "At Woodstock, as a New York kid barely known outside the coffeehouse circuit in Greenwich Village, she sang her song, \"Beautiful People\" and inspired the first panorama of candles and cigarette lighters ever raised at a concert event. That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.

September 24 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nThe Slackers are self styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll from New York City. The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "date": "2016-09-24T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Where song, spirit, and speaking meet.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "Save these dates to head over to beautiful Buhr Park (unless noted otherwise) and see fast paced, full contact roller derby action from your local league, Ann Arbor Derby Dimes!\n\nMay 14 - June 11 - July 9 - August 6\n\nBUY 2016 SEASON PASSES: http://bpt.me/2537986\n\nMay 14\nBrawlstars vs The Chicago Outfit: Syndicate\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs East Lansing Roller Derby: Broadbarians\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/1reSK5y\nBUY MAY 14 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2537998\n\nJune 11\nBrawlstars vs North Star Roller Girls: Supernovas\nArbor Bruising Co. vs North Star Roller Girls: Northern Lights\nBUY JUNE 11 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2538000\n\nJuly 9\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Border City Brawlers: All-Stars\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Border City Brawlers: Canadian Clubbers\nBUY JULY 9 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539693\n\nAugust 6\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Flint City Derby Girls\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Killamazoo Derby Darlins: Kill Squad\nBUY AUGUST 6 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539697\n\nFor more information, see our 2016 season schedule: http://a2derbydimes.org/2016-schedule", "date": "2016-10-14T17:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/192972824428594/", "name": "Ann Arbor Derby Dimes 2016 season"}, {"description": "lauriemcclain.com", "date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197527007266742/", "name": "Laurie McLain at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "Two nights with Steppin' in It's fast-rising lead vocalist", "date": "2016-10-21T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1668844700041158/", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 1"}, {"date": "2016-10-22T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/215744518775574/", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 2"}, {"description": "Michigan's bluegrass and Americana success story", "date": "2016-10-23T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1696673723915750/", "name": "Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys"}, {"description": "Tue.

His spoken introductions to his songs can be as spellbinding as his colorful lyrics, which he brings to life with a well-travelled voice and a delivery that's natural and conversational. His groove-oriented strumming and fingerpicking draw on influences from the mountains of western North Carolina where he now lives, and from lots of different good old traditional folk stuff of all kinds.
