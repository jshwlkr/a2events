Utopia Toolbox contains an anthology of texts, quotations, interviews, documentation of art and design projects, and do-it-yourself actions and performances.\n\nThe contributions in practice and in text are from a broad array of disciplinary rubrics, including philosophy, art, science, technology, economics, and spirituality. They also provide perspectives from across the stages of life--from an 8 year-old child to octogenarian physicist Hans-Peter Duerr. In content and in proximity to one another, the wide-ranging contributions offer unexpected and fresh impulses, directions, estimations, suggestions and approaches to serve as a catalyst for creativity. The book encourages new and unknown combinations of thinking and also contains a number of empty pages for readers to sketch their own ideas and thinking processes.\n\nNick Tobier is an Associate Professor at the Stamps School of Art and Design and the Center for Entrepreneurship in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan.

Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Backin the Ring. Chris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet,Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, TheLumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records. Chris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases.In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist. Her latest album, Backin the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimedHow I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons. \u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms.For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards. \n\nWSG: Anna Vogelzang\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/595", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-28T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Chris Pureka w/ Anna Vogelzang 4/28/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/837506396394371/", "description": "The second season for AFC Ann Arbor kicks off April 29th at 7PM with a friendly against Oakland County FC.  \n\nBeginnng at 5pm, supporters will gather at Arbor Brewing Company for prematch festivities at the Official Pub of AFC Ann Arbor.

The Wolverine State has been the birthplace, home, and inspiration to a tremendous number of men and women of letters, both the well-known and the obscure. Ink Trails II tells the stories of these fascinating and diverse writers whose talent is inextricably linked to Michigan.Exploring the hidden treasures of otherwise forgotten authors while also acknowledging the Michigan-set stories of giants like Hemingway, Dave and Jack Dempsey delve into the state\u2019s literary heritage, as robust, diverse, and inexhaustible as the natural beauty of the place that nurtured it. This second volume of \u201cink trails\u201d continues to tell the story of the remarkable writers, powerful words, and sublime nature of Michigan in the same well-researched and entertaining prose as the first.\n\nAbout Yamasaki in Detroit: Although his best-known project was the World Trade Center in New York City, Japanese American architect Minoru Yamasaki (1912\u20131986) worked to create moments of surprise, serenity, and delight in distinctive buildings around the world. In his adopted home of Detroit, where he lived and worked for the last half of his life, Yamasaki produced many important designs that range from public buildings to offices and private residences. In Yamasaki in Detroit: A Search for Serenity, author John Gallagher presents both a biography of Yamasaki\u2014or Yama as he was known\u2014and an examination of his working practices, with an emphasis on the architect\u2019s search for a style that would express his artistic goals. Both knowledgeable fans of modernist architecture and general readers will enjoy Yamasaki in Detroit.\n\nAbout The Orbit Magazine Anthology: With a mischievous globe-headed mascot that appeared in every issue and even on Quentin Tarantino\u2019s T-shirt in Pulp Fiction, Orbit was an instantly recognizable arbiter of 1990s Detroit culture. But its irreverent tone and unique editorial features could be traced to two earlier local publications from creator Jerry Peterson, a.k.a. Jerry Vile\u2014White Noise (1978\u20131980) and Fun: The Magazine for Swinging Intelectuals [sic] (1986\u20131990). In The Orbit Magazine Anthology: Re-Entry, author Rob St. Mary details the full run of White Noise, Fun, and Orbit, collecting two decades\u2019 worth of Detroit\u2019s alternative publishing history into an oversized, heavily illustrated volume that situates the publications in the city\u2019s pop culture and media history. Anyone interested in Detroit arts and culture or the history of alternative publishing will be grateful for The Orbit Magazine Anthology.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, May 2, 2016 - 7:00pm", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-02T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Michigan Notable Books: Dave & Jack Dempsey, John Gallagher, & Rob St. Mary"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1713725442238131/", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n-       May 3 - Isaac Berkowitz and Chris Bota\nIsaac Berkowitz and Chris Bota are guitarists in the Michigan rock band, Desmond Jones.

Her days are spent designing cool new car parts, but her evenings are filled with writing and cats. She has traveled solo to seventeen countries on five continents. Her other hobbies include hunting for the perfect cup of coffee, exploring used book stores, and accidentally climbing mountains. \n\nElena Bozzi's love of stories began, she imagines, before she was born. From an early age, she learned that stories were beautiful ways to connect with others. Eventually, after consuming copious amounts of written words, she decided it would be proper to give back to the book world. She hopes you will enjoy, are enjoying, or have enjoyed Puddle, her first novel. To write it, she listened deeply to many forests, and knows much of this story came directly from them.\n\n'27 Days to Midnight'\n\nEveryone in Dahlia\u2019s world knows when they\u2019re going to die. Except her.\n\nHer father has never shown her the pocket watch counting down the days she has left to live. When he sacrifices himself to save her from her scheduled death, Dahlia abandons her comfortable home and sets off after his murderer to uncover the secrets her father died to protect\u2026and the time research that could bring him back to life.\n\nThen she meets Farren Reed. She should hate him. He\u2019s an enemy soldier, a cowardly deserter, and the most insufferable man Dahlia\u2019s ever met. Still, she needs all the help she can get, and Farren is the only chance she has to find the man who murdered her father. But Farren has only twenty-seven days left on his watch.\n\n'Puddle: A Tale for the Curious'\n\nBirch loves her garden. Her sanctuary is the nearby forest. She understands that adventures can happen at any moment, especially when there are cats involved. When she witnesses a boy crawl from a puddle that wouldn't cover a toad, she suspends her disbelief in order to see his side of the tale.\n\nGet your feet wet with Birch and Puddle as they travel to worlds by way of the reflections upon puddles.

Chris will be joined in conversation by Brit Bennett, author of The Mothers (coming from Riverhead in October).\n\nA vivid and assured work of fiction from a major new voice, following the life of a young man growing up, leaving home, and coming back again, marked by the stark beauty of California's Mojave Desert and the various fates of those who leave and those who stay behind. This series of powerful, intertwining stories illuminates Daley Kushner's world--the family, friends and community that have both formed and constrained him, and his new lief in San Francisco. Back home, the desert preys on those who cannot conform: an alfalfa farmer on the outskirts of town; two young girls whose curiosity leads to danger; a black politician who once served as his school's confederate mascot; Daley's mother, an immigrant from Armenia; and Daley himself, introspective and queer. Meanwhile, in another desert on the other side of the world, war threatens to fracture Daley's most meaningful--and most fraught--connection to home, his friendship with Robert Karinger. A luminous debut, Desert Boys traces the development of towns into cities, of boys into men, and the haunting effects produced when the two transformations overlap. Both a bildungsroman and a portrait of a changing place, the book mines the terrain between the desire to escape and the hunger to belong.\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is hilarious, devious, original, and unforgettable; Chris McCormick writes with a joyful swerve and swagger that is all his own.\u201d\u2015Karen Russell, New York Times bestselling author of Vampires in the Lemon Grove\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is a show off's debut, the work of an unabashed polyglot. There seems to be nothing Chris McCormick can't do: smartypants metafictional experiment, heart-pounding thriller, eulogy for boyhood bonds, meditation on sexuality and post-9/11 intolerance. These linked stories assemble into a kind of compound eye through which we glimpse an oft-forgotten corner of California and, most superbly, a fresh take on masculine Americana. McCormick is the artsy outsider, the affectionate anthropologist, the near-feral boy with a wide-angle lens of history.\u201d\u2015Claire Vaye Watkins, author of Battleborn and Gold Fame Citrus\n\n\"In the hands of this young master of purified prose, ambition, love, and the restlessness of boyhood are trapped as if in a crystal vial. No reader will be able to turn away.\"\u2015Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen\n\n\u201cChris McCormick\u2019s book is a gift from the new West. In the dry, highland exurbs of Los Angeles and other exotic places, McCormick crafts lustrous tales of brotherhood, immigrants, love, and paintball. Filled with unforgettable characters, Desert Boys is a deeply moving journey through the natural and emotional landscapes of the American present.\u201d\u2015H\u00e9ctor Tobar, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Down Dark and The Barbarian Nurseries\n\n\u201cThis is a book about place, or really like so many books about place (Dubliners, Winesburg, Ohio) two places, in this case two Californias\u2015San Francisco on the one hand; the less familiar but finely evoked small desert community from which the narrator originates on the other. But it's also a book about shame, two shames, the shame of where we come from, and the shame of leaving it. Through a series of quietly intimate confessions we learn how torn the teller is between past and present, small town and big city, and McCormick captures this tension beautifully in the contrast between his laconic, but frankly feeling prose and his restless formal innovation. Wise and vulnerable by turns, this is a quietly stunning debut.\u201d\u2015Peter Ho Davies, author of The Welsh Girl\n\nChris McCormick was raised in the Antelope Valley. He earned his B.A. at the University of California, Berkeley, and his M.F.A. at the University of Michigan, where he was the recipient of two Hopwood Awards.

Then the mines closed, and the town wore away like a bar of soap. Now Bakerton has been granted a surprise third act: it sits squarely atop the Marcellus Shale, a massive deposit of natural gas. To drill or not to drill?  Prison guard Rich Devlin leases his mineral rights to finance his dream of farming. He doesn\u2019t count on the truck traffic and nonstop noise, his brother\u2019s skepticism or the paranoia of his wife, Shelby, who insists the water smells strange and is poisoning their frail daughter.  Meanwhile his neighbors, organic dairy farmers Mack and Rena, hold out against the drilling\u2014until a passionate environmental activist disrupts their lives.\n\nHeat and Light depicts a community blessed and cursed by its natural resources. Soaring, ambitious, it zooms from drill rig to shareholders\u2019 meeting to the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor to the ruined landscape of the \u201cstrippins,\u201d haunting reminders of Pennsylvania\u2019s past energy booms.

This event is sponsored by the Michigan Humanities Council and is free and open to the public.\n\nStation Eleven is an audacious, darkly glittering novel about art, fame, and ambition set in the eerie days of civilization's collapse. One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time\u2014from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as The Travelling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains\u2014this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet. Sometimes terrifying, sometimes tender, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it.\n\nEmily St. John Mandel is the author of four novels, most recently Station Eleven, which was a finalist for a National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award, and won the 2015 Arthur C. Clarke Award. A previous novel, The Singer's Gun, was the 2014 winner of the Prix Mystere de la Critique in France.

May 11 | 9pm | 18+ | $20 Cover\n\nHailing from Oakland, California, Del the Funky Homosapien and his crew, the Hieroglyphics came out as a markedly non-gangster response to a burgeoning West Coast scene. After being put on at the tender age of 17 by his cousin Ice Cube, Del released two records on Elektra, I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991) and No Need For Alarm (1993). Despite record sales in the hundreds of thousands, he recorded a third album, Future Development, which was never commercially released. Del parted with Elektra and started work on the Hieroglyphics..family album, 3rd Eye Vision (Hiero Imperium, 1998). Hiero went on the road and toured incessantly in support of the album for much of 1998. Del also spent a good portion of his time drawing, practicing Japanese, and playing mass amounts of video games. Finally ready to unleash a new record on the world, Del comes with BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. Seventeen tracks of pure Del. He says of his work on this album: ..\"I've had complete control\". At times, Del has felt restrained by the formulas in hip hop and the expectations fans place upon emcees who have had hits. I wish that I had the same freedom that someone like Bjork has when she puts out an album..Apart from collaborations with PrincePaul, El-P (Company Flow), and help from a few of his Hiero cohorts (A-plus, Casual, Domino) Del handled the majority of production on this album. By staying true to himself, Del has earned legions of adoring fans. He may have said it best in his classic, Mistadobalina when he declared all in the mind and the heart.

Following her first Wheatland Festival in 2012, Mainville fell in love with the idea of performing her own songs on stage, which eventually inspired her 2014 gypsy swing and baroque pop debut EP, Full Steam Ahead.\n\n        Since the release of her first solo output, Olivia has forged a unique path within the Mitten scene, becoming known alongside her band, the Aquatic Troupe, for their energized, dynamic performances and their gargantuan musical talent.

She\u2019s also made appearances at significant festivals and venues throughout the Mitten, such as Blissfest in Harbor Springs, the Majestic in Detroit, and the Ark in Ann Arbor. Between Olivia and her band mates, the Aquatic Troupe is capable of playing 11 instruments, ranging from guitar and violin to the trumpet, accordion, and omnichord \u2013 all of which encompass their collective sound.\n\n \u201cI really love that we\u2019re growing as a band,\u201d says Olivia. \u201cWe are always exploring new styles and inviting other musicians into our live shows to lend their talents and expand our sound.

These techniques provided a source of physical and spiritual strength when devastating illness struck her family. Inspired by the Buddha\u2019s transformational teachings, she set out to learn as much as she could about who he was. By profession a librarian, Shelley immersed herself in research on the time, place, and spiritual traditions that 2500 years ago produced Prince Siddhartha, who became the Buddha. Yoga, in some form, has a role in all of these traditions. While studying yoga\u2019s history, Shelley began her own practice, which proved as transformational as Buddhist meditation.\n\nBecause she loves historical fiction, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha. Unsatisfied with what she found, she decided to write her own. Her research had sparked her curiosity about Yasodhara, the woman who became Siddhartha\u2019s wife, and she became inspired by the personal and spiritual struggles of women who knew him. She began to write the Sadhana trilogy, three novels that tell their stories.\n\nShelley hung up her black belt to practice Iyengar yoga. Both disciplines have enriched her world and the world of her books.\n\n'The Tigress and the Yogi'\n\nA talking tigress...a wandering yogi...\n\nWhen the outcaste girl Mala meets these two, it sets her on a journey from slavery to freedom through an ancient land where chaos threatens gods and mortals alike.

Born in Trim, Co. Meath, to John Keenan, Sr. of Westmeath and the former Mary Bravender of Co. Cavan. The Keenans were a Travelling family steeped in traditional music; both Paddy's father and grandfather were uilleann pipers. Paddy himself took up the pipes at the age of ten, playing his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, when he was 14. He later played with the rest of his family in a group called The Pavees. At 17, having fallen in love with the blues, Paddy left Ireland for England and Europe, where he played blues and rock. Returning to Ireland after a few years, he began playing around Dublin with singer/keyboardist Triona Ni Dhomhnaill and singer/guitarist Micheal O Dhomhnaill. Fiddler Paddy Glackin joined the three, then flute player Matt Molloy, accordionist Tony MacMahon, and guitarist Donal Lunny. Thus was born one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, The Bothy Band. Paddy was one of the band's founding members, and his virtuosity on the pipes combined with the ferocity of his playing made him, in the opinion of many, its driving force. Bothy Band-mate Donal Lunny once described Paddy as \"the Jimi Hendrix of the pipes\".\n\nSince the breakup of The Bothy Band in 1979, Paddy has toured as a soloist, bringing the finest example of traditional Irish music and uilleann piping to audiences around the globe, performing in Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Australia, across Europe, Russia, and of course America.\n\nVisit Paddy on the web here: http://www.paddykeenan.com/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-22T17:30:00-04:00", "name": "Paddy Keenan- In Concert"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/192972824428594/", "description": "Save these dates to head over to beautiful Buhr Park (unless noted otherwise) and see fast paced, full contact roller derby action from your local league, Ann Arbor Derby Dimes!\n\nMay 14 - June 11 - July 9 - August 6\n\nBUY 2016 SEASON PASSES: http://bpt.me/2537986\n\nMay 14\nBrawlstars vs The Chicago Outfit: Syndicate\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs East Lansing Roller Derby: Broadbarians\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/1reSK5y\nBUY MAY 14 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2537998\n\nJune 11\nBrawlstars vs North Star Roller Girls: Supernovas\nArbor Bruising Co. vs North Star Roller Girls: Northern Lights\nBUY JUNE 11 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2538000\n\nJuly 9\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Border City Brawlers: All-Stars\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Border City Brawlers: Canadian Clubbers\nBUY JULY 9 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539693\n\nAugust 6\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Flint City Derby Girls\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Killamazoo Derby Darlins: Kill Squad\nBUY AUGUST 6 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539697\n\nFor more information, see our 2016 season schedule: http://a2derbydimes.org/2016-schedule", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-24T17:00:00-04:00", "name": "Ann Arbor Derby Dimes 2016 season"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1532863607016540/", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n- May 24 Heather Schwartz\nhttp://www.heatherschwartzmusic.com/\n\nHeather Schwartz has become known for creating a unique concert experience, with a vintage charm and passionate vocals she truely connects with her audience.

Laith has been a staple of the Michigan music scene for most of his adult life.

The album was recorded live to 2-track with no edits, overdubs, autotune or compression at the world famous Ocean Way Recording Studios in Hollywood. The album features a dream-band of musicians such as Jim Keltner (Drums), Leland Sklar (Bass), Larry Goldings (Hammond B-3), Jimmy Vivino (Rhythm Gtr/ Backing Vox), Tom Scott (Sax), Lee Thornburg (Tpt), Brandon Fields (Bari Sax), Nick Lane (Trombone / Horn Arranger) and more... \nThe soulful new album harkens back to the great musical traditions of New Orleans and Chicago with a splash of Blues, Country, Gospel, and Roots Rock and is arguably Al-Saadi's best work to date.\nhttp://www.laithmusic.com \n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

Now, he issues the sharpest entry of his vision, the majestic The Blackberry Train engineered by Steve Albini (Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been an evolution,\u201d James says. \u201cThis set of songs definitely has a harder edge, but it\u2019s a continuation of the last album. The main thing for me is to not conform or compromise.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 panoramic artistry is inspired by such diverse musicians as Kurt Cobain, The Smiths, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, The Cure, The Beatles, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, and Hank Williams. His fingerprint aesthetic has earned him plaudits from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Daily News. He\u2019s earned a strong following the old fashioned way, through tirelessly touring the US, Europe and the UK, and playing bigger and bigger shows with each go around.\n\nThe Blackberry Train is an epiphanic co-mingling of aesthetics. James sought out the distinct audio stylings of Steve Albini to conjure a grungier sensibility. He welcomed the engineer\u2019s gifts for capturing music with a raw clarity, and Steve Albini\u2019s reputation for not impinging on an artist\u2019s vision. The results make for an eclectic album with fastidiously crafted songs documented in the studio with glorious purity.\n\n\u201cI like the music to have elements of the avant garde, psychedelic, and be just a little against the grain,\u201d James reveals. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about having as much emotion as possible for me, musically and lyrically. It\u2019s all about the music being cathartic, heartfelt and true.\u201d\n\nThe Blackberry Train manages to be both diverse and cohesive. The album opens invigoratingly with the jangling rocker, \u201cToo Hard\u201d and closes with the stately and aptly named folk song \u201cPeace and Stillness.\u201d Between these bookends, highlights include the rough-edged and urgently melodic \u201cUnicorn,\u201d the anthemic \u201cPeyote Coyote,\u201d and the soulful ballad \u201cPrayer.\u201d One very personal song is the winsome and reflective \u201cWaterfall\u201d which was inspired by memories of his mother.\n\nThis summer and fall James will embark on extensive tour dates in the U.S. Thinking ahead, James says: \u201cI just want to keep on going, keep working, and improving as a songwriter. I\u2019d love to feel that I realized my full potential both as a person, and as a songwriter. That feels like a great, fulfilling goal to shoot for.

Originally named Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. with typical irreverence, the duo of Joshua Epstein (also of the Silent Years) and Daniel Zott came together in Detroit in 2009. Working out of a basement studio, the pair worked to create a sound that was danceable without sacrificing anything in the songwriting department, merging intricate and airy melodies with solid programmed beats and synth atmospherics.\nTheir hard work bore fruit in 2010 when they released their debut EP, Horse Power, on Quite Scientific, quickly followed by the EP My Love Is Easy: Remixes Pt. 1. That same year, the pair was also tapped to do a remix of Moby's \"Wait for Me.\" The resulting buzz from their early releases led to a record deal with Warner Bros., who released their Record Store Day-exclusive EP titled We Almost Lost Detroit in spring 2011. The duo's full-length debut, It's a Corporate World, followed that summer. In 2013, they returned with an EP, Patterns, before releasing their sophomore full-length, The Speed of Things, later that year. \nIn 2015, even though they had the blessing of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. himself, to avoid ongoing confusion by fans and seekers of the race car driver, Epstein and Zott decided to change the band's name to simply JR JR. Their first LP under the shortened handle and their third with Warner Bros., the endearing JR JR was released that September\nwww.jrjrmusic.com \n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

His lyrics speak directly to a younger generation that hears, sees, and thinks about the very things he\u2019s writing. From their opening song to the finale of their set, the Ben Daniels Band cuts through with their originality, musicianship, and a sound that spans Americana, Blues, Jazz, and Rock.\nThroughout years of touring, BDB has played numerous venues in Michigan, New York City, Washington D.C., and Nashville . As a solo artist, Ben has stepped on the stage in Austin, TX at the Cactus Cafe, as well as The Barns at Wolf Trap. The son of actor Jeff Daniels, he has quietly monitored what it takes to live life as an artist. Beyond a passed down talent, the Ben Daniels Band believes in hard work, perseverance, and creatively challenging themselves and their audience.\nWith George Merkel on guitar, Tommy Reifel on bass, Wesley Fritzemeier on drums/mandolin, and Amanda Merte on percussion/vocals, BDB\u2019s live show never fails to take over the venue. With five CDs under their belts - Coming From The C, Checkin\u2019 In To The Michigan Inn, Can't You See, The Mountain Home EP, and their dual album & movie release Old Gold - the Ben Daniels Band is has grown to be a formidable group that sounds pleasantly familiar, yet unforgettably unique.\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

Just as much influenced by classic rock & roll, country, Latin and Southern hip hop as they are the Stax/Volt or Muscle Shoals era, The Suffers are bringing a fresh approach to what they have coined Gulf Coast Soul. Late night legend David Letterman proclaimed in early 2015 \"If you cant do this, get out of the business\", let it be known that The Suffers are here to stay! With a year that included performances for NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, Newport Folk Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival and The Late Show, The Suffers have delivered over 150 stirring performances of their signature 3rd Coast Soul sound to thousands of new and old fans alike. The large ensemble packs each position of the rhythm and horn section with a level of talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin's massive voice. The band's sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. Their 2016 self-titled debut album is set to hit shelves on February 12th and will be the continuation of what 2015's Make Some Room EP started.

In 2006, Dennen signed with Dualtone and released So Much More. Hope for the Hopeless followed on the same imprint in 2008. Dennen's fourth studio effort, Loverboy, which featured subtle African rhythms and more of a pop veneer, arrived in April of 2011, followed in 2013 by the sparser acoustic-based Smoke and Mirrors and 2014 \nrelease of Out of My Head.

Show by show, in venues ranging from rock clubs and performing arts centers to festivals encompassing everything from bluegrass to electronica, The Ragbirds developed a well-deserved reputation as one of the most dynamic, high-spirited live bands in roots music.\nThe Ragbirds albums have received local and national praise, hailed \u201cHighly impressive!\u201d by USA Today and touted as \u201cAstounding international eclecticism\u201d by Reveal Arts.  The band has performed in over forty-five states to a tune of 150+ shows a year, The Ragbirds have become festival favorites.  They have won over crowds at  Electric Forest, 10,000 Lakes, CMJ Music Marathon, Summer Camp, Wheatland, Blissfest, Wookiefoot\u2019s Harvest Fest,  Ann Arbor Folk Festival, Hookahville, to name a few; and have shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Rusted Root, Matisyahu, Railroad Earth, John Butler Trio,  Toubab Krewe,  Cornmeal, Greensky Bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum,  Jeff Daniels, The Everyone Orchestra, The Duhks, and many others.For all their traveling, The Ragbirds maintain a steady connection to their home base.  While reflecting on Michigan, Erin had this to say \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a beautiful place to be, snuggled in the Great Lakes, close enough to hold hands with Canada. It is connected to a secret, mysterious, magical place called the U.P., but most of all there is an amazingly talented and humbly supportive music community that spreads through the state, clustered into groups in Ann Arbor and Lansing, Grand Rapids, Flint, Traverse City and Detroit.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, its no wonder why they are headlining festivals and one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album \u201cTerra Incognita \u201c goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments, and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.

September 24 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nThe Slackers are self styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll from New York City. The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-24T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/472892626244546/", "description": "Where song, spirit, and speaking meet.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/257954421222460/", "description": "Our Monthly Beer tasting series explore the expansive world of beer through the lens of different themes.
