Originally named Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. with typical irreverence, the duo of Joshua Epstein (also of the Silent Years) and Daniel Zott came together in Detroit in 2009. Working out of a basement studio, the pair worked to create a sound that was danceable without sacrificing anything in the songwriting department, merging intricate and airy melodies with solid programmed beats and synth atmospherics.\nTheir hard work bore fruit in 2010 when they released their debut EP, Horse Power, on Quite Scientific, quickly followed by the EP My Love Is Easy: Remixes Pt. 1. That same year, the pair was also tapped to do a remix of Moby's \"Wait for Me.\" The resulting buzz from their early releases led to a record deal with Warner Bros., who released their Record Store Day-exclusive EP titled We Almost Lost Detroit in spring 2011. The duo's full-length debut, It's a Corporate World, followed that summer. In 2013, they returned with an EP, Patterns, before releasing their sophomore full-length, The Speed of Things, later that year. \nIn 2015, even though they had the blessing of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. himself, to avoid ongoing confusion by fans and seekers of the race car driver, Epstein and Zott decided to change the band's name to simply JR JR. Their first LP under the shortened handle and their third with Warner Bros., the endearing JR JR was released that September\nwww.jrjrmusic.com \n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor. Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts. Each week a different area restaurant is on-site selling a Sonic Lunch for concert-goers to purchase. Other restaurants offer special discounts for concert-goers to pick up to take to the park.\n\nSonic Lunch concerts are free and suitable for all ages. Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers.

Somewhere in a middle ground between Frank Zappa and Tom Waits, this show that gets curiosity seekers out with the promise of tits keeps them in the seats with a set of original tunes that get stuck in your head for weeks after the performance. \u201cPeople are surprised by the songwriting!

A natural poet, this young songwriter went to school on Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson, and Jack White, among others. His lyrics speak directly to a younger generation that hears, sees, and thinks about the very things he\u2019s writing. From their opening song to the finale of their set, the Ben Daniels Band cuts through with their originality, musicianship, and a sound that spans Americana, Blues, Jazz, and Rock.\nThroughout years of touring, BDB has played numerous venues in Michigan, New York City, Washington D.C., and Nashville . As a solo artist, Ben has stepped on the stage in Austin, TX at the Cactus Cafe, as well as The Barns at Wolf Trap. The son of actor Jeff Daniels, he has quietly monitored what it takes to live life as an artist. Beyond a passed down talent, the Ben Daniels Band believes in hard work, perseverance, and creatively challenging themselves and their audience.\nWith George Merkel on guitar, Tommy Reifel on bass, Wesley Fritzemeier on drums/mandolin, and Amanda Merte on percussion/vocals, BDB\u2019s live show never fails to take over the venue. With five CDs under their belts - Coming From The C, Checkin\u2019 In To The Michigan Inn, Can't You See, The Mountain Home EP, and their dual album & movie release Old Gold - the Ben Daniels Band is has grown to be a formidable group that sounds pleasantly familiar, yet unforgettably unique.\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

Each week a different area restaurant is on-site selling a Sonic Lunch for concert-goers to purchase. Other restaurants offer special discounts for concert-goers to pick up to take to the park.\n\nSonic Lunch concerts are free and suitable for all ages. Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers.

Just as much influenced by classic rock & roll, country, Latin and Southern hip hop as they are the Stax/Volt or Muscle Shoals era, The Suffers are bringing a fresh approach to what they have coined Gulf Coast Soul. Late night legend David Letterman proclaimed in early 2015 \"If you cant do this, get out of the business\", let it be known that The Suffers are here to stay! With a year that included performances for NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, Newport Folk Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival and The Late Show, The Suffers have delivered over 150 stirring performances of their signature 3rd Coast Soul sound to thousands of new and old fans alike. The large ensemble packs each position of the rhythm and horn section with a level of talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin's massive voice. The band's sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. Their 2016 self-titled debut album is set to hit shelves on February 12th and will be the continuation of what 2015's Make Some Room EP started.

In 2006, Dennen signed with Dualtone and released So Much More. Hope for the Hopeless followed on the same imprint in 2008. Dennen's fourth studio effort, Loverboy, which featured subtle African rhythms and more of a pop veneer, arrived in April of 2011, followed in 2013 by the sparser acoustic-based Smoke and Mirrors and 2014 \nrelease of Out of My Head.

Show by show, in venues ranging from rock clubs and performing arts centers to festivals encompassing everything from bluegrass to electronica, The Ragbirds developed a well-deserved reputation as one of the most dynamic, high-spirited live bands in roots music.\nThe Ragbirds albums have received local and national praise, hailed \u201cHighly impressive!\u201d by USA Today and touted as \u201cAstounding international eclecticism\u201d by Reveal Arts.  The band has performed in over forty-five states to a tune of 150+ shows a year, The Ragbirds have become festival favorites.  They have won over crowds at  Electric Forest, 10,000 Lakes, CMJ Music Marathon, Summer Camp, Wheatland, Blissfest, Wookiefoot\u2019s Harvest Fest,  Ann Arbor Folk Festival, Hookahville, to name a few; and have shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Rusted Root, Matisyahu, Railroad Earth, John Butler Trio,  Toubab Krewe,  Cornmeal, Greensky Bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum,  Jeff Daniels, The Everyone Orchestra, The Duhks, and many others.For all their traveling, The Ragbirds maintain a steady connection to their home base.  While reflecting on Michigan, Erin had this to say \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a beautiful place to be, snuggled in the Great Lakes, close enough to hold hands with Canada. It is connected to a secret, mysterious, magical place called the U.P., but most of all there is an amazingly talented and humbly supportive music community that spreads through the state, clustered into groups in Ann Arbor and Lansing, Grand Rapids, Flint, Traverse City and Detroit.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, its no wonder why they are headlining festivals and one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album \u201cTerra Incognita \u201c goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments, and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

Hailing from Chelmsford Essex in the UK, in the six years since the release of his genre-defining debut album \u2018Lucky Shiner\u2019, the electronic artist most comfortable with the moniker Derwin Panda spent the subsequent years splitting the majority of his time between London, Berlin and countless excursions to Japan. As he created his third album \u2018\u2019Good Luck And Do Your Best\u2019 he ultimately found himself back where he began, in the East of England.\n\nOrigin stories can be fundamentally boring by nature, packed with non-essential details and overly stressed homilies to roots and influences. But the core nature of an artist that has produced some of the most beloved and emotionally-infused electronic music of this decade is deeply rooted in the constant desire to return to where his musical world began.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/710", "name": "Gold Panda 9/15/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1186311131413949/"}, {"date": "2016-09-16T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "The Free Speech (While Supplies Last) tour", "name": "Second City\u2014Night 1", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1275355069146738/"}, {"date": "2016-09-16T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "At Woodstock, as a New York kid barely known outside the coffeehouse circuit in Greenwich Village, she sang her song, \"Beautiful People\" and inspired the first panorama of candles and cigarette lighters ever raised at a concert event. That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock.

After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/"}, {"date": "2016-09-26T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Where song, spirit, and speaking meet.

King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is Sound of the Broken. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/"}, {"date": "2016-10-12T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "A spicy roots cocktail from Venice, CA.", "name": "The Dustbowl Revival", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1716825161907547/"}, {"date": "2016-10-13T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Saline High School's nationally recognized fiddle ensemble", "name": "The Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/2588083667997550/"}, {"date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Freshmen no more!", "name": "The Verve Pipe", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1746959058909209/"}, {"date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "lauriemcclain.com", "name": "Laurie McLain at Green Wood Coffee House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197527007266742/"}, {"date": "2016-10-21T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Two nights with Steppin' in It's fast-rising lead vocalist", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 1", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1668844700041158/"}, {"date": "2016-10-22T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 2", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/215744518775574/"}, {"date": "2016-10-23T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Michigan's bluegrass and Americana success story", "name": "Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1696673723915750/"}, {"date": "2016-10-25T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Tue.

October 27 | 8pm | All Ages | $25 Cover\n\nann arbor's 107one Presents:\nBrett Dennen wsg: Lily & Madeleine\n\nAs common and simple as it is, \"por favor\" is such an evocative expression. From Spanish, it translates to \"please,\" a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. \"Por favor' was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,\" says Brett Dennen. \"We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.\"\n\n\"When you say please, you're asking something to come into your life,\" Dennen adds. \"It might mean that you're weak and need something to make you strong. But you're admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.\"\n\nThat notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen's intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.\n\n\"All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn't feeling confident about myself,\" he says. \"When I'm not feeling confident, I'm not a nice person to be around. I don't take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I'm in that place.\"\n\nA followup to 2013's Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It's the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it's by no means a sad affair, nor is it the \"rainyday record\" Dennen initially thought he was making.\n\nOften framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. \"And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let's go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,\" he sings over a chugging groove on \"Bonfire.\"\n\nOn \"Where We Left Off,\" the album's emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: \"Everyone knows I'm a happy man/ But I haven't been right.\"\n\n\"Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,\" Dennen admits. \"Is there something I'm scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren't in that zone.\"\n\n\"I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,\" he continues. \"I don't have to worry about whether they'll be on the radio or if they're different from my previous stuff.\"\n\nHoled up at Cobb's Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb's insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. \"We recorded it the way people made records in the '60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,\" he says. \"We didn't do anything more than five times. We didn't secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It's not sloppy, but it's in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.\"\n\nCobb adds, \"I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He's very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.\"\n\nMore than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. \"My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,\" he says.\n\nThat marked a detour from his most recent releases. With those he felt like he was exercising his craftsmanship - \"being a songwriter for the sake of being a songwriter,\" as he puts it. \"I really wanted this new album to come across as a whole piece,\" Dennen says. \"I consider it to be a batch of songs that all live together and complement each other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the album title. Please.\n\n\"What was I asking for with this album\" Dennen says. \"I wanted to be a good person and feel good about myself again, but in a way that I knew it was OK to be sad. That's part of life, the ups and downs. But with these songs, I want to make people feel good about themselves and about life through the good and bad.\"\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/718", "name": "Brett Dennen w/ Lily and Madeleine 10/27/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1735261526750729/"}, {"date": "2016-10-28T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "There is no better storyteller than Chuck Brodsky.  Ranging from poignant to hilarious, his songs are about the little things in the lives of everyday people.

His spoken introductions to his songs can be as spellbinding as his colorful lyrics, which he brings to life with a well-travelled voice and a delivery that's natural and conversational. His groove-oriented strumming and fingerpicking draw on influences from the mountains of western North Carolina where he now lives, and from lots of different good old traditional folk stuff of all kinds.

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/619658961515550/"}, {"date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "http://www.donhenry.com/", "name": "Don Henry at Green Wood Coffee House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513216465641630/"}, {"date": "2016-11-18T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Fri.
