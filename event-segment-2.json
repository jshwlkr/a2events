Drones, when referring to unmanned aerial vehicles, have entered the consciousness of society as mechanisms of surveillance, telematic violence, and killing, as well as liberating new modalities of viewing (especially as prices of these types of vehicles have come down).\n \nIn music, a drone is a harmonic or monophonic effect or accompaniment where a note or chord is continuously sounded throughout most or all of a piece. Finding expression in various folk traditions (classical Indian tambura, Australian didgeridoo, or the Scottish bagpipe for example) and contemporary interpretations (the avant-garde sounds of La Monte Young), of course the constant hum and buzz of these and other machines (from the industrial to the digital) just adds to this inevitable lexical collision.\n \nThe pun was first explored within the publication of Issue #2, Drone Score, where the drone homonyms were explored through representational marks of notation. The first, tally marks, highlighted the total number of deaths resulting from US military drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Sudan (the same diagonal/horizontal slash marks often found on fighter airplanes marking the number of tallied kills made by the pilots). This was countered with a musical notation of La Monte Young\u2019s Composition #7 from 1960 (which shares more than a graphical semblance with the tally marks echoing the seemingly endless clusters of five, which musically notate a perfect 5th).\n \nThe performance activates the initial notational and representational form into a live experiential event, where drone imagery is montaged and contrasted with an ensemble playing a drone composition, to generate a tensioned visual unfolding that activates the dramatic attack of the audio score.\n \nVideo includes imagery mixed from prerecorded drone sourced video (military, industrial, hobbyist, journalist, etc.), real time streamed video from drones present on site, video projection of drone bees, projected on three screens, all choreographed by artist Osman Khan. A soundscape based on La Monte Young\u2019s Composition #7 score, accompanying the visuals, is performed live by an ensemble of musicians led by composer and multi-instrumentalist James Cornish.\nCollaborators:\nOsman Khan\nPeter Halquist\nWith live score composed by James Cornish, featuring\nRachel McIntosh, mezzo soprano\nMichael Malis, keyboard \nBetsy Soukup, bass\nBen Willis, bass\nMolly Jones, reeds\nMatthew Daher, percussion\nJames Cornish, trumpet", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1661685450802399/", "name": "Drone: expanded cinema performance"}, {"date": "2017-03-25T10:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Do you like photography and spending time outdoors?

But how do the powerful extract consent from citizens whose own self-interest and collective well-being are constantly denied? And why do so many Americans seem to have given up on quality public education, on safe food and safe streets, on living wages\u2014even on democracy itself? Kill It to Save It lays bare the hypocrisy of contemporary US political discourse, documenting the historical and theoretical trajectory of capitalism\u2019s triumph over democracy.\n\nTackling the interconnected issues of globalization, neoliberalism, and declining public institutions, Corey Dolgon argues that American citizens now accept reform policies that destroy the public sector (seemingly in the public interest) and a political culture that embraces what Stephen Colbert calls \u201ctruthiness\u201d\u2014a willingness to agree to arguments that feel right \u201cin the gut\u201d regardless of fancy science or messy facts. In a narrative that stretches from the post\u2012Vietnam War era to the present parade of political reality TV and debates over Black Lives Matter, Dolgon dismantles US common-sense cultural discourse. His original, alternative account reveals that this ongoing crisis in US policy will not cease until a critical mass of American citizens recognize what has been lost, and in whose interest.\n\nCorey Dolgon is professor of sociology and director of community-based learning at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts. He is the author of three other books, including the award-winning The End of the Hamptons: Scenes from the Class Struggle in America\u2019s Paradise.\n\nEvent date: \nThursday, March 30, 2017 - 7:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1248070058647051/", "name": "Corey Dolgon"}, {"date": "2017-03-30T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "In 1969, National Geographic photographer Loren McIntyre became hopelessly lost in a remote part of the Brazilian rainforest while searching for the Mayoruna people.\n\nHis encounter tested his perception of the world, bringing the limits of human consciousness into startling focus.

Taylor is in the company of naturalist poets such as Gary Snyder and Mary Oliver-poets who often drew from an Emersonian sensibility to create art that awakens the mind to its corresponding truths in the natural world. The book ranges from the longer poem to the eight line, unrhymed stanza similar to that of the T'ang poet Han-Shan. And without section breaks to reinforce the passing of time, the collection creates greater fluidity of movement from one poem to the next, as if there is no beginning or end, only an eternal moment that is suspended on the page. Tom Pohrt's original illustrations are scattered throughout the text, adding a stunning visual element to the already vivid language. The book moves from the author's travel accounts to the destruction of the natural world, even species extinction, to more hopeful poems of survival and the return of wildness. The natural rhythm is at times marred by the disturbances of the twenty-first century that come blaring into these meditations, as when a National Guard jet rumbles over the treeline upsetting a hummingbird, and yet, even the hummingbird is able to regain its balance and continue as before. At its core, Taylor's collection is a reminder of Emerson's idea that natural facts are symbols of spiritual facts.\n\nKeith Taylor has authored or edited 16 books and chapbooks, including his most recent small collection, Fidelities (Alice Greene and Co., 2015). His last full length collection was If the World Becomes So Bright, and his next one, The Bird-while, will be published by Wayne State University Press in February, 2017. He has also co-edited several collections of fiction and non-fiction, including a recent collection of contemporary Michigan ghost stories. His poems, stories, reviews and translations have appeared widely in North America and in Europe. He has received Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs. He teaches at the University of Michigan where he also serves as Associate Editor of Michigan Quarterly Review and director of the Bear River Writers Conference. He spends his summers teaching at the University of Michigan Biological Station near Pellston.\n\nIllustrator and children's author Tom Pohrt grew up in the automobile-manufacturing town of Flint, Michigan. A self-taught artist whose love of animals is evident in his artwork, Pohrt has been interested in writing and drawing ever since he was a little boy. Despite his lack of guidance as a youngster, Pohrt has become a well-established illustrator, working with texts by authors such as Philippa Pierce, Julia Durango, and Jim Harrison as well as penning the text for two self-illustrated books featuring his original stories. \"The precise, delicate lines of his drawings, coupled with his slightly moody, sepia-toned palette, suggest antique etchings,\" wrote a Publishers Weekly contributor in reviewing Pohrt's work for Howard Norman's Trickster and the Fainting Birds, the critic dubbing the picture book \"beautifully designed and presented.\"\n\nPohrt is the winner of the Lee Bennett Hopkins Award for Children's Poetry, 2004, for The Wishing Bone and Other Poems by Stephen Mitchell; American Library Association Notable Children's Book designation, 2004, for The Little Gentleman by Philippa Pearce.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197544120728965/", "name": "Meet Poet Keith Taylor & Illustrator Tom Pohrt"}, {"date": "2017-04-04T12:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Commemorating the University of Michigan\u2019s 2017 Bicentennial, Victors for Art: Michigan\u2019s Alumni Collectors celebrates the deep impact of Michigan alumni in the global art world.

Fastpitch softball is one of the most widely played sports in the world, with tens of millions of active participants in various age groups. But the origins of this beloved sport and the charismatic athletes who helped it achieve prominence in the mid-twentieth century have been largely forgotten, until now.\n\nFastpitch brings to life the eclectic mix of characters that make up softball\u2019s vibrant 129-year history. From its humble beginnings in 1887, when it was invented in a Chicago boat club and played with a broomstick, to the rise in the 1940s and 1950s of professional-caliber company-sponsored teams that toured the country in style, softball\u2019s history is as diverse as it is fascinating. Though it\u2019s thought of today as a woman\u2019s sport, fastpitch softball\u2019s early years featured several male stars, such as the vaudeville-esque Eddie Feigner, whose signature move was striking out batters while blindfolded. But because softball was one of the only team sports that women were allowed to play competitively, it took on added importance for female athletes. Top fastpitch teams of the 1940s, \u201850s, and \u201860s, such as the New Orleans Jax Maids and Connecticut\u2019s Raybestos Brakettes, gave women access to employment and travel opportunities that would have been unavailable to them otherwise. At a time when female athletes had almost no prospects, softball offered them a chance to flourish. Women put off marriage and moved across the country just for a shot at joining a strong team.\n\nTold from the perspective of such influential players as Bertha Ragan Tickey, who set strikeout records and taught Lana Turner to pitch, and Joan Joyce, who struck out baseball legend Ted Williams and helped found a professional softball league with Billie Jean King, Fastpitch chronicles softball\u2019s rich history and its uncertain future (as evidenced by its controversial elimination from the 2012 Olympics and the mounting efforts to have it reinstated). A celebration of this unique American sport and the role it plays in our culture today, Fastpitch is as entertaining as it is inspiring.\n\nErica Westly is a journalist whose work has appeared in Slate, Wired, The Smart Set, Self, Esquire, Popular Science, and The New York Times. Fastpitch is her first book.\n\nEvent date: \nTuesday, April 4, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Matthews's prize-winning collection, Simulacra.\n\nA fresh and rebellious poetic voice, Airea D. Matthews debuts in the acclaimed series that showcases the work of exciting and innovative young American poets. Matthews\u2019s superb collection explores the topic of want and desire with power, insight, and intense emotion. Her poems cross historical boundaries and speak emphatically from a racialized America, where the trajectories of joy and exploitation, striving and thwarting, violence and celebration are constrained by differentials of privilege and contemporary modes of communication. In his foreword, series judge Carl Phillips calls this book \u201crollicking, destabilizing, at once intellectually sly and piercing and finally poignant.\u201d This is poetry that breaks new literary ground, inspiring readers to think differently about what poems can and should do in a new media society where imaginations are laid bare and there is no thought too provocative to send out into the world.\n\nAirea D. Matthews's first collection of poems, Simulacra, received the 2016 Yale Series of Younger Poets Award (Yale University Press, 2017). Her work has appeared in Best American Poets 2015, American Poets, Four Way Review, The Indiana Review, and Michigan Quarterly Review, and elsewhere. She received the 2016 Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award and has awarded the Louis Untermeyer Scholarship in Poetry from the 2016 Bread Loaf Writers' Conference. She received her B.A. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, her M.P.A. from the University of Michigan, and her M.F.A. from the University of Michigan Helen Zell Writers' Program. Ms. Matthews is working on her second poetry collection, under/class, which explores the behavioral and cultural ramifications of poverty. She lives in Detroit, Michigan, with her husband and four children.\n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, April 5, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Yeats's \"middle stage\" and composed of poems written during World War I, The Wild Swans at Coole is contemplative and elegiac. This collection captures Yeats at a time when he was looking back on his life, coming to terms with the realities of modern war, reflecting on lost love, and defining his place in the world as a poet. It features forty poems, among them \"The Fisherman,\" \"In Memory of Major Robert Gregory,\" \"The Wild Swans at Coole,\" and \"On Being Asked for a War Poem.\" \nThis facsimile of the original 1919 edition presents the reader with the work in its original form, with handsome old fashioned type, how readers and Yeats himself would have seen it in the early twentieth century. A great gift book and collector's item, The Wild Swans at Coole also includes an Introduction and notes by esteemed Yeats scholar George Bornstein.\n\nGeorge Bornstein attended Harvard University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1963. He then attended Princeton University, where he earned his Doctorate in 1966.

April 15 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nProtomartyr  \nwsg: Paint Thinner & Double Winter\n\nI asked Joe Casey once why he chose to start his first band with a group of guys roughly ten years his junior. His answer was simple: He needed them, needed this, needed Protomartyr. He didn\u2019t want to end up singing classic rock covers in a carport or dive bar one night a week. At 35, with no musical background and crippling stage fright, he needed friends who were young and hearty enough to want to write and record and practice and tour and be heard as badly as he did then. He\u2019d just lost his father to an unexpected heart attack, and his heartbroken mother to the beginnings of Alzheimer\u2019s shortly thereafter. He\u2019d come to understand, all too intimately, how brutal and finite a life can be. Consider then the urgency with which he joined his bandmates\u2014guitarist Greg Ahee, drummer Alex Leonard, and bassist Scott Davidson, fellow alums of the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy\u2014for the first time, in a basement full of unsuspecting onlookers. Consider the urgency with which they\u2019ve approached everything since\u2014three albums in three years, each more extraordinary and rewarding than the last. This music is inherently, unassumingly high stakes. I can think of no other band that moves me like they do.\n\nThis October marks the release of The Agent Intellect, their third and finest work to date.  Named after an ancient philosophical questioning of how the mind operates in relation to the self, it\u2019s an elegant and often devastating display of all that makes Protomartyr so vital and singularly visceral an outfit. Over the course of several months, Ahee waded through more than a hundred song fragments until he reached the bottomless melodies of \u201cI Forgive You\u201d and \u201cClandestine Time\u201d, the inky depths of \u201cPontiac \u201987\u201d and titanic churn of \u201cWhy Does It Shake?\u201d Lyrically, Casey is at his most confident and haunting. He humanizes evil on \u201cThe Devil in His Youth,\u201d and, amid the charred pop of \u201cDope Cloud,\u201d he reassures us that nothing\u2014not God, not money\u2014can or will prevent our minds from unraveling until we finally fade away. We are no one and nothing, he claims, without our thoughts. It\u2019s a theme that echoes through the entirety of the record, but never as beautifully as it does on \u201cEllen.\u201d Named after his mother and written from the perspective of his late father, it\u2019s as romantic a song as you\u2019re likely to hear this or any year, Casey promising to wait for her on the other side, with the memories she\u2019s lost safely in hand.\n\nI remember a story he told me in Detroit. A few months earlier, he\u2019d been driving with his mother as a Protomartyr recording played on the stereo.\n\n\u201cJoe,\u201d she asked him. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is us, Mom,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said, \u201cThis is very good.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014David Bevan, July 2015", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/360856157630319/", "name": "Protomartyr 4/15/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2017-04-15T22:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Dude Trance\nGroup 2: 50 Shades of Cray Cray \nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1839536612979044/", "name": "Pointless Improv with Dude Trance and 50 Shades of Cray Cray"}, {"date": "2017-04-16T12:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "March 11\u2013August 20, 2017\nPhotography Gallery\n\nIn 2013, artist Ernestine Ruben (BSDEs \u201953) photographed the once-famed industrial complex Willow Run in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II.\nFor this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body\u2019s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist.

Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II.\nFor this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body\u2019s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist.

Inspired by her grandmother\u2019s tales of cooking on the family farm, Thielen moves with her artist husband to the rustic off-the-grid cabin he built in the woods in northern Minnesota. There, standing at the stove three times a day, she finds the seed of a growing food obsession that sends her on a wild ride through diverse kitchens and eras\u2014from her mother\u2019s 1970s suburban electric range to a turn-of-the-century farmhouse to a hot plate in an illegal warehouse squat\u2014and finally to the sensory madhouse of New York\u2019s top haute cuisine brigades. When she returns to her rural cabin, she comes face-to-face with her past and its veritable cellar of taste memories, discovering that good food can be made anywhere\u2014and that beneath every foie gras sauce lies a rural foundation of potatoes and onions. \n\n\"Give a Girl a Knife\" offers a fresh, vivid view into New York\u2019s high-end restaurant scene before returning Thielen to her roots, where she realizes that the marrow running through her bones is not demi-glace at all, but gravy\u2014honest, irresistible, and thick with the complications of home. \n\nAMY THIELEN is a chef, TV cook, and two-time James Beard Award\u2013winning writer. She is the author of \"The New Midwestern Table\" (2013), hosted Heartland Table on Food Network, and worked for celebrated New York City chefs David Bouley, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Daniel Boulud before moving back home to the Midwest. Amy speaks widely about home cooking and contributes to radio programs and magazines, including SAVEUR Magazine, where she\u2019s a contributing editor. She lives with her husband, visual artist Aaron Spangler, their son, his dog, and a bunch of chickens, in Park Rapids, Minnesota.
