Nenadic & M. Joanne Nesbit for an evening of discussion about Ann Arbor Icons and Legends.\n\nWhat is an iconic Ann Arbor restaurant? Ask anyone who has ever spent time there as a student, traveler, or townie, and they are likely to name several favorites in an instant. From debating the best place to celebrate or console on football Saturdays to deciding where to eat after the bars close, the choices have always sparked passionate conversation. In Ann Arbor, people are known to have strong feelings about the best places for pizza, coffee, beer, burgers, noodles, and burritos. Although many of the go-to hangouts are long gone, a surprising number still thrive. And there are always a few newcomers coming along to win the hearts of the next generation of diners, nibblers, and noshers. Some are fine restaurants and taverns, and others are lunch counters, diners, carry-outs, and drive-ins but in each and every case, they are unique and together make up a collection of iconic local eateries.\n\nGraced by the Huron River with an abundance of parks, Ann Arbor offers residents and visitors entertainment, sports, shopping, dining, and of course, the University of Michigan. Legendary Locals of Ann Arbor celebrates its citizens. Some of those who make up Ann Arbor are creative artists, inspiring educators, dedicated public servants, and determined business owners. With the exception of Lewis the cat, who reigned at Downtown Home and Garden, this book is filled with stories about people who have made and are making Ann Arbor one of the best places to live in the United States. Within its pages lie the stories of who chose maize and blue as the University of Michigan s colors; who was the first Ann Arborite to race in the Indy 500; and who sold Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino s, his first pizzeria.

Born and raised in Alabama, James Boggs came to Detroit during the Great Migration, becoming an automobile worker and a union activist. Grace Lee was a Chinese American scholar who studied Hegel, worked with Caribbean political theorist C. L. R. James, and moved to Detroit to work toward a new American revolution. As husband and wife, the couple was influential in the early stages of what would become the Black Power movement, laying the intellectual foundation for racial and urban struggles during one of the most active social movement periods in recent U.S. history. \n\nStephen Ward details both the personal and the political dimensions of the Boggses' lives, highlighting the vital contributions these two figures made to black activist thinking. At once a dual biography of two crucial figures and a vivid portrait of Detroit as a center of activism, Ward's book restores the Boggses, and the intellectual strain of black radicalism they shaped, to their rightful place in postwar American history.\n\nStephen Ward, Associate Professor at the University of Michigan Residential College, is a historian in the Social Theory and Practice program and is jointly appointed in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies. He was the founding coordinator of the Urban Studies minor and serves as the faculty director of the Semester in Detroit program. He teaches courses in African American history, urban and community studies, and Detroit history. He is the author of In Love and Struggle: The Revolutionary Lives of James and Grace Lee Boggs (2016) and the editor of Pages From a Black Radical's Notebook: A James Boggs Reader (2011). He is a board member of the James and Grace Lee Boggs Center to Nurture Community Leadership in Detroit.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-01T19:00:00-05:00", "name": "Meet U of M RC Prof & Author Stephen Ward"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/978748282251935/", "description": "Come out of the cold and see some of your favorite Burlesque performers!

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound. With support from the likes of Diplo, Omarion, and JoJo, plus tours with artists like Chance the Rapper, Flume and Chet Faker, the producer has clearly caught the eye some of a wide variety of tastemakers. Featured by the likes of Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Boiler Room and The FADER, Cuna has also received admiration from music journalists the world over, drawing almost universal praise from disparate outlets. With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory. And that\u2019s part of the reason why Cuna connects with his fan base on such a visceral level, eschewing traditional industry methods for his own unique, intimate manner of going about business.\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/768", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-02T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Sweater Beats12/2/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1643997675892579/", "description": "Our League of Pointless Improvisers will invite audience members and performers to share their holiday tales, and will then create an improvised show based on these. \nNo two shows are the same! \nTickets are $10.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-02T22:00:00-05:00", "name": "Crazy Holiday Feats"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/280243392370950/", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

The low-resolution LEDs create a tension between representation and abstraction, provoking viewers to interpret visual information on their own. In the three-channel video It\u2019s My Island Laitinen builds his own island in the Baltic Sea by dragging two hundred sand bags into the water over a period of three months. The work explores ideas of nationality, citizenship, and identity as the artist creates his own single-citizen micro-nation. Lemercier\u2019s computer-generated print Landforms uses patterns of black dots and projected light to create the illusion of three-dimensionality and movement when seen from a distance. The effects are more realistic than a still image, but still unsettlingly artificial. Silva\u2019s Render Garden explores the digitized landscape, including remix and glitch aesthetics, through software that endlessly generates new plant combinations.\nThroughout the next year UMMA will present a series of exhibitions drawn from the Borusan Contemporary Art Collection in Istanbul. The Borusan\u2019s thirty-year-old collection includes significant works across a variety of genres, and since 2011 it has focused on media arts. The works exhibited here address formal concerns such as abstraction and color, and conceptual topics such as identity or ecological issues; many represent traditional categories such as portraiture and landscape that find new resonance when explored through the strategies of dynamic technology.\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Susan and Richard Gutow Fund, the Herbert W. and Susan L.

But trouble finds LL when she runs into Haze, a talented graffiti artist whose sister Heather was murdered two years before. Freerunner and Writer promptly fall in love, but they decide to hide their relationship till they're sure it's the real thing-and until they can find a way to placate LL's hotheaded brother, who has it in for Haze and his gang. But when portraits of LL-done in Haze's distinctive style-start popping up on city walls, all hell breaks loose. LL's brother threatens a gang war, which LL tries to avert by identifying the Writer who is really responsible for the paintings. But when another teen is murdered, it looks bad for Haze, especially when LL discovers that Heather's killer and her portrait-painter are one and the same.\n\n********\nLaura Wolfe: \n\nLaura is a wife and mother to two children and a lover of animals and nature.

Almost, Maine is a town that\u2019s so far north, it\u2019s almost not in the United States\u2014it\u2019s almost in Canada. And it almost doesn\u2019t exist. Because its residents never got around to getting organized. So it\u2019s just\u2026Almost.

A note about this play from the playwright: \n\n\nThe people of Almost, Maine are not quaint, quirky eccentrics. They don't wear funny clothes and funny hats.  They don't have Maine accents.  They are not \"Down Easters.\"  They are not fishermen or lobstermen.  They don't wear galoshes and rain hats. They don't say, \"Ayuh.\" \n\nThe people of Almost, Maine are ordinary people. They work hard for a living.  They are extremely dignified. They are honest and true.  They are not cynical. They are not sarcastic. They are not glib. But this does not mean that they are dumb.  They're very smart. They just take time to wonder about things.  They speak simply, honestly, truly, and from the heart. They are never precious about what they say or do.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-04T14:00:00-05:00", "name": "Auditions for Almost, Maine"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/214594198975054/", "description": "Join us for an afternoon with four local debut Young Adult authors for a discussion and signing. \n\nAuthors participating: Kirstin Bartley Lenz, Heather Smith Meloche, Darcy Woods and Erica M.

She's enjoyed a roaming life with her mountaineering parents, making the natural world her jungle gym, the writings of Annie Dillard and Henry David Thoreau her textbooks. But when tragedy strikes on an Ecuadoran mountaintop, Cara's nomadic lifestyle comes to an abrupt halt. \nStarting over at her grandparents home in suburban Detroit, Cara embarks on a year of discovery, uncovering unknown strengths, friendships, and first love.

He loves the thrill, and each adventure allows a little release because his smug smile and suave demeanor in the face of authority doesn t make life at home with his mom any less tough. He tries to take care of her, but the truth is he's powerless in the face of her fragile mental health. So he copes in his own way, by defacing public property and pulling elaborate pranks, though he knows in the end this ll only screw up his life even more. \n\nAs they both try not to let their self-destructive patterns get the best of them, Tessa and Jack gravitate toward one another, discovering the best parts of themselves in the process.

Seating is first-come, first-served.\nPresented by: Swarupa Anila, Director of Interpretive Engagement, Detroit Institute of Arts\n\nAs museums strive to serve broad, ever-diversifying publics, it is no longer possible to deny the ways museums mirror and reinforce racial, cultural, and class inequities of the broader society. Skillful racial and cultural representation in interpretation and programming is not only an intellectual exercise; it is an ethical responsibility that requires fracturing the known through consistent individual and institutional self-reflection and action. This talk focuses on the challenging and often painful internal work toward developing diversity and strategies and actions supporting systemic change in museum representation, interpretation, and ideation.\n\nSwarupa Anila is director of interpretive engagement at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Key issues she pursues in interpretive planning practice include examining whose voices and perspectives are missing in museum interpretation, how to integrate visitor voices to flatten museum and art historical knowledge hierarchies, and how to design museum interpretation that supports dynamic, meaningful visitor engagements with art.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Museum Studies website.\nCo-sponsored by the U-M Museum of Art", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-06T18:30:00-05:00", "name": "U-M Museum Studies Program Presents: \"Inclusion Requires Fractur"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/679963915514271/", "description": "In his Wine Report 2005, British wine writer Tom Stevenson honored Larry Mawby with the title \u201cfizzmaster exraordinaire\u201d.

His poetry is represented in major anthologies including The Oxford India Anthology of Poetry and The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Indian Poetry. He has authored several poetry collections including his latest, Final Cut, along with a memoir, The Ocean in My Yard (Penguin, 2005). \n\nSigning to follow.\n\nThe event begins with an Open Mic session when area poets can read their own work or share a favorite poem by another author in a welcoming atmosphere. This event is part of a poetry series held on the second Thursday of most months at 7pm.\n\n(NOTE: There will not be an Open Mic event in January 2017. )\n\nSaleem Peeradina is one of the most important Indian poets writing in the English language. In Final Cut, his fifth collection, the poet\u2019s focus is turned towards the beauty that lies below the surface of the everyday; the extraordinary hiding in the ordinary.\n\nThese poems are hymns of praise \u2013 to birds, to objects, to fruits and to our own human bodies, intently recounting the character and history of each. In time, items as mundane as a sparrow, a stapler or an orange take on the appearance of wondrous gifts.\n\nThese meditations are joined by monologues, the remarkable yet unremarkable stories of characters encountered by the poet in India, Michigan and beyond. This is the work of a master of language; a self-proclaimed \u2018participant-observer\u2019, set to delight a new generation of poetry readers with this enthralling collection.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-08T19:00:00-05:00", "name": "Open Mic & Share Poetry Series feat Saleem Peeradina"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/581967308677138/", "description": "Come take it back to the 90s with ABSWS!!!

A Chuck Mitchell's show combines his seasoned skills as an actor, singer and guitarist with a selection of delightful material. He sings cabaret songs by Brecht and Weil -- \"Mack the Knife\" and \"The Bilbao Song\" -- and whimsical songs by Flanders & Swann -- \"The Gnu\" and \"Have Some Madeira, M'dear\". He roves the room singing \"Freeborn Man\" by Ewan McColl, or \"Necessity\" from Finian's Rainbow. He weaves poetry by Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot into his shows.

Sign up for the street team by clicking here: http://bit.ly/2b3tDvt\n\nDOPAPOD: \n\nThe Boston born, now generally Northeast based, but ever on-the-go Dopapod has come a long way from their college basement, DIY party roots. While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-14T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Dopapod & Pigeons Playing Ping Pong at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/324709987912141/", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

An accomplished instrumentalist, she began playing the classical guitar at 11. Influenced by edIT, Bonobo, The Widdler and Amon Tobin, she started producing electronic music at the age of 16.\n\nIn 2014, she won the 'Best International Newcomer of 2013' at the UK Glitch-Hop Award.\n\nHer tracks defy genres, oscillating between World Bass, Tribal Trap, Glitch-Hop, Trip-Hop, and Downtempo. She created her own place in the glitch community, thanks to a unique, highly surprising style, mixing powerful basslines, funky off beat percussion and emotional cinematic sounds. A musical identity which led her to play in the USA (including the festivals Coachella, Lightning In A Bottle, Shambhala...), Canada, India, Berlin, and more than 30 cities in France, alongside artists like Bonobo, Gramatik, Chet Faker, Tipper, TOKiMONSTA, Tipper, Big Gigantic, GRiZ...\n\nRunner-up of several remix contests (launched by artists like Mr. Bill, Asian Trash Boy, Crazy Daylight, Daenine...), CloZee was spotted by respected labels such as Gravitas Recordings, Glitch Hop Community, Adapted Records, Digital Whomp, Empathy Recordings, MOR Records, Waxhole Records\u2026 \n\nWebsite - http://www.clozeemusic.com/\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/clozee\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/CloZee \n\nPsymbionic\nCresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound.\n\nJohn Burcham has been moving bodies and turning heads as Psymbionic for several years in all corners of the USA, playing with acts such as Bassnectar, STS9, Big Gigantic, ill.Gates, Excision, EOTO, and Tipper. His passion and innovation in the music world are showcased through album releases on Muti Music and MalLabel, as well as in his role as label manager for the popular Electronic imprint Gravitas Recordings.\n\nIn a live show context, Psymbionic confronts mixes that are limited to the scope of the build and release, avoiding an industry epidemic of drop-monotony that overpowers the flow of music. Burcham seeks to prove that there are more powerful influences in moving a crowd than simple tension, providing an interwoven dynamic that relies on the strength of his blend, rather than the sole force or familiarity of the apex.\n\nPsymbionic's theory of music is a journey that doesn't visit the same place twice, building excitement for what's next not because you can anticipate it, but because you've never been there before.\n\nWebsite - http://www.psymbionicmusic.com/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/psymbionic\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/psymbionic", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-15T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "CloZee & Psymbionic - Biohackers Tour at Necto - 12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/558399577690989/", "description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-16T15:00:00-05:00", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/241191552964337/", "description": "Bring your well-worn items that could use a tune up, and we'll take a look at them! \n\nOr, make someone else's day by volunteering at Fix-It Friday and repairing their items.\n\nFix-It Friday:\nThink of this as the last chance before you get rid of something; Free, but no Guarantee.\n\nWe will:\n- try to diagnose what is wrong\n- tell you if we think we may be able to fix it today\n- tell you if you'll need a part, and where you might be able to get it\n- try to fix it to the best of our ability, but in the limited time we have\n\nHowever, we may not be able to fix it.

January 28 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nHiss Golden Messenger\nThe writing of the songs that became Heart Like a Levee started in a hotel room in Washington, DC , in January of 2015 during a powerful storm that darkened the East Coast. At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-01-28T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Hiss Golden Messenger 1/28/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/270514846618930/", "description": "Inon Barnatan, piano\nAnthony McGill, clarinet\nAlisa Weilerstein, cello\n\nThis powerhouse trio brings together some familiar faces.\n\nInon Barnatan was the featured piano soloist with the New York Philharmonic last fall, Anthony McGill is the New York Philharmonic\u2019s principal clarinetist, and Alisa Weilersten has performed on both the Choral Union Series and the Chamber Arts Series in recent years.
