He wrote his first raps at the age of six and hasn't looked back since. Born in Illinois but moved to Arizona in high school, Futuristic's flow seems to be just as hot as his surroundings. His album \"The Rise\" released on May 12th 2015 debuted at #2 on itunes and #9 on Hip-Hop Billboard charts. He has been touring virtually non-stop over the last 2 years headlining his own tours and supporting bigger acts such as Somo & Machine Gun Kelly. His fast witty lyrics mixed with substance and relatable subject matter has gained him a die hard fan base called WTFGang which stands for \"We're The Future\". As an independent artist Futuristic takes pride in his creativity and versatility using his words to inspire his fans and let them know that anything is truly possible but also gives them music to BANG with the top down in the summer. Moving forward he expects to be exactly what he named his lead single from his album.... \"The Greatest\". Futuristic recently was featured on A Great Big World single \"Hold Each Other\" which has led him to National television performances on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, VH1 Streamy Awards, Performing for the Vice President Joe Biden & CEO of Apple Time Cook, for the HRC National Dinner in Washington D.C.\n\nGood music arguably comes from a place that is insightful, meaningful and modern.This is where the living weirdo known as Devvon Terrell lives and sleeps. Hailing from Brooklyn, New York the singer has his own urban style and sound that is a testament to his generation.\n\nDevvon Terrell took the internet by storm, showcasing his talent on various remixes and cover videos on youtube that have gained him as much as 200,000 views on a single video.\n\n \n\nDevvon Terrell wears a variety of hats to translate his music to his audience. From shooting and editing videos to engineering, mixing and mastering all of his music. This jack of all trades mentality has earned him placements with And One Live, C2C Dj Khaled's Halftime Report, a number one Mixtape on Datpiff.com and countless other mediums. Devvon Terrell recently released his first album titled \"Weird Sexy Cool\" and earned a the spot of top 16 albums on the itunes RNB charts. With all his endeavors on the rise Devvon Terrell will surely make the transformation from local talent, to mainstream superstar.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1042945595776720/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Futuristic and Devvon Terrel 4/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-18T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Literati is thrilled to welcome Amy Gustine in support of her acclaimed debut collection, You Should Pity Us Instead.\n\nYou Should Pity Us Instead explores some of our toughest dilemmas: the cost of Middle East strife at its most intimate level, the likelihood of God considered in day-to-day terms, the moral stakes of family obligations, and the inescapable fact of mortality.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/769930223136488/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-19T09:00:00-04:00", "description": "Oats & Woes & Babo, Oh My!\n\nBabo presents Oats & Woes Ann Arbor a local oatmeal pop-up!

Notable works include a biography of Niels Bohr and the fast-paced tale of the desperate lives of early paleontologists and \"T-Minus: The Race to the Moon\", from Aladdin books. He has worked as a nuclear engineer and is currently employed as a reference librarian in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nEnglish mathematician and scientist Alan Turing (1912 1954) is credited with many of the foundational principles of contemporary computer science. \"The Imitation Game\" presents a historically accurate graphic novel biography of Turing's life, including his groundbreaking work on the fundamentals of cryptography and artificial intelligence. His code breaking efforts led to the cracking of the German Enigma during World War II, work that saved countless lives and accelerated the Allied defeat of the Nazis. While Turing's achievements remain relevant decades after his death, the story of his life in post-war Europe continues to fascinate audiences today. \nAward-winning duo Jim Ottaviani (the #1 \"New York Times \"bestselling author of \"Feynman \"and \"Primates\") and artist Leland Purvis (an Eisner and Ignatz Award nominee and occasional reviewer for the \"Comics Journal\") present a factually detailed account of Turing's life and groundbreaking research as an unconventional genius who was arrested, tried, convicted, and punished for being openly gay, and whose innovative work still fuels the computing and communication systems that define our modern world.

April 21 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nI don\u2019t know how to write a bio for an album. I\u2019ve never written one. I\u2019m a comedian. My job is to talk onstage for long enough that the trapped, drunken audience has to buy more chicken wings from the club. I am not qualified to write about music. And yet here I am, writing a bio for the new The Thermals record, We Disappear. Thank god it\u2019s a great fucking record.\n\nThe first time I heard The Thermals was on broken headphones while riding the A Train to Rockaway, Brooklyn, flying mere feet over a frozen Jamaica Bay on a too-bright January morning. I had just fallen in love with a wonderful, terrible woman who was thousands of miles away. I was very fragile, I had no boundaries, and I was the strongest I\u2019d ever been. And that\u2019s how this album feels. There\u2019s a new vulnerability here, but The Thermals\u2019 sound is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nThe Thermals are best at making songs you put on mixtapes named \u2018Drunken Sing-alongs When You\u2019re Sad.\u2019 They specialize in late-night, secret conversations about feeling simultaneously romantic and resentful over being raised Catholic. They\u2019re the soundtrack to breaking glass, and an ode to the beauty of brokenness.\n\nThey say that the mark of intelligence is the ability to hold two disparate and conflicting truths in the mind at the same time: I am a good person; I am not a good person. We Disappear lives in this delicate, in-between place: at once hard and noisy, while also soft and personal. And seeming contradictions abound on this album. We Disappear is an all-too-real, dark, and intensely personal album \u2013 in the past most of singer Hutch Harris\u2019 lyrics have been mostly fictitious tales \u2013 about how we try to outrun demise, whether personal or physical. It is an emotional document of how two people can tear each other apart, while simultaneously making you wanna get up and jump around the room.\n\nThe deeply dark, yet oddly catchy \u201cHeart Went Cold\u201d plays on the double metaphor of loss of love/life and features the sad realization \u201cI pushed you away\u201d, but is immediately followed by the super poppy \u201coh-oh oh\u201d. The classic fucking rock anthem \u201cHey You\u201d is a paranoid fantasy about running from the Grim Reaper as he calls after you, about \u201cbeing terrified of death,\u201d says Harris, but \u201ca celebration of that feeling as opposed to feeling sad about it.\u201d A surprisingly uplifting eulogy of the death of a relationship, \u201cThinking Of You\u201d is explained by Harris as \u201cone of the most straight-forward love songs we\u2019ve ever written, a point-blank post-break up song. It\u2019s a song that says exactly what it means. It and a lot of the record are about regret, i.e. still loving someone after a break-up and hanging on to these feelings.\u201d\n\nWe Disappear is also about separation in terms of technology, how it can isolate us and impact our relationships, and how humans have embraced it to the point where we\u2019ve already assimilated into it. \u201cThe Great Dying\u201d and \u201cInto the Code\u201d examine how we\u2019re so afraid we\u2019re going to be forgotten, or overlooked, that we upload everything about our lives onto the Internet.\n\nHarris explains, \u201cTechnology, love and death are the three obsessions of the record. Our privacy used to be so important to us and now everything has changed \u2013 we freely offer once private information about relationships and reveal everything about our day-to-day lives. We\u2019re trying to preserve our life digitally so when we\u2019re gone people won\u2019t forget us. We\u2019re using technology to become immortal. You can even set up Facebook and Twitter accounts to continue updating after you die! We Disappear is about how humans fight the inevitable.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure you want to know that the record will come out March 25th, 2016 on Saddle Creek, that it features the longest running Thermals line-up of Hutch Harris, Kathy Foster, and Westin Glass, and that it was recorded in Portland, OR at Kung Fu Bakery (The Shins, Tegan and Sara) and in Seattle, WA at The Hall of Justice (Nirvana, Mudhoney), and produced by Chris Walla (formerly of Death Cab For Cutie). But what really matters is that this record GETS IT. It walks that fine line between truth and lies, between death and life, between depression and joy \u2013 all the while recognizing that one cannot exist without the other. And it brings us with it. That\u2019s the reason to listen to this record: Because it\u2019s a fucking great album, by an amazing band.

Utopia Toolbox contains an anthology of texts, quotations, interviews, documentation of art and design projects, and do-it-yourself actions and performances.\n\nThe contributions in practice and in text are from a broad array of disciplinary rubrics, including philosophy, art, science, technology, economics, and spirituality. They also provide perspectives from across the stages of life--from an 8 year-old child to octogenarian physicist Hans-Peter Duerr. In content and in proximity to one another, the wide-ranging contributions offer unexpected and fresh impulses, directions, estimations, suggestions and approaches to serve as a catalyst for creativity. The book encourages new and unknown combinations of thinking and also contains a number of empty pages for readers to sketch their own ideas and thinking processes.\n\nNick Tobier is an Associate Professor at the Stamps School of Art and Design and the Center for Entrepreneurship in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan.

Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Backin the Ring. Chris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet,Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, TheLumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records. Chris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases.In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist. Her latest album, Backin the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimedHow I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons. \u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms.For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards. \n\nWSG: Anna Vogelzang\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/595", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1318721681600135/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Chris Pureka w/ Anna Vogelzang 4/28/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-29T12:00:00-04:00", "description": "FRESH + FIT!\nStarting April 1, babo and FitPoint  want to help you optimize your diet and fitness.

From an early age, she learned that stories were beautiful ways to connect with others. Eventually, after consuming copious amounts of written words, she decided it would be proper to give back to the book world. She hopes you will enjoy, are enjoying, or have enjoyed Puddle, her first novel. To write it, she listened deeply to many forests, and knows much of this story came directly from them.\n\n'27 Days to Midnight'\n\nEveryone in Dahlia\u2019s world knows when they\u2019re going to die. Except her.\n\nHer father has never shown her the pocket watch counting down the days she has left to live. When he sacrifices himself to save her from her scheduled death, Dahlia abandons her comfortable home and sets off after his murderer to uncover the secrets her father died to protect\u2026and the time research that could bring him back to life.\n\nThen she meets Farren Reed. She should hate him. He\u2019s an enemy soldier, a cowardly deserter, and the most insufferable man Dahlia\u2019s ever met. Still, she needs all the help she can get, and Farren is the only chance she has to find the man who murdered her father. But Farren has only twenty-seven days left on his watch.\n\n'Puddle: A Tale for the Curious'\n\nBirch loves her garden. Her sanctuary is the nearby forest. She understands that adventures can happen at any moment, especially when there are cats involved. When she witnesses a boy crawl from a puddle that wouldn't cover a toad, she suspends her disbelief in order to see his side of the tale.\n\nGet your feet wet with Birch and Puddle as they travel to worlds by way of the reflections upon puddles. Prowl with Caht, the cat who spells its name with an h, and arrange necessary... encounters.. with Nimupara, the Watcher of Worlds. Dance all night with the Trees, as they share their stories and their secrets.

This event is sponsored by the Michigan Humanities Council and is free and open to the public.\n\nStation Eleven is an audacious, darkly glittering novel about art, fame, and ambition set in the eerie days of civilization's collapse. One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time\u2014from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as The Travelling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains\u2014this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet. Sometimes terrifying, sometimes tender, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it.\n\nEmily St. John Mandel is the author of four novels, most recently Station Eleven, which was a finalist for a National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award, and won the 2015 Arthur C. Clarke Award. A previous novel, The Singer's Gun, was the 2014 winner of the Prix Mystere de la Critique in France.

May 11 | 9pm | 18+ | $20 Cover\n\nHailing from Oakland, California, Del the Funky Homosapien and his crew, the Hieroglyphics came out as a markedly non-gangster response to a burgeoning West Coast scene. After being put on at the tender age of 17 by his cousin Ice Cube, Del released two records on Elektra, I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991) and No Need For Alarm (1993). Despite record sales in the hundreds of thousands, he recorded a third album, Future Development, which was never commercially released. Del parted with Elektra and started work on the Hieroglyphics..family album, 3rd Eye Vision (Hiero Imperium, 1998). Hiero went on the road and toured incessantly in support of the album for much of 1998. Del also spent a good portion of his time drawing, practicing Japanese, and playing mass amounts of video games. Finally ready to unleash a new record on the world, Del comes with BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. Seventeen tracks of pure Del. He says of his work on this album: ..\"I've had complete control\". At times, Del has felt restrained by the formulas in hip hop and the expectations fans place upon emcees who have had hits. I wish that I had the same freedom that someone like Bjork has when she puts out an album..Apart from collaborations with PrincePaul, El-P (Company Flow), and help from a few of his Hiero cohorts (A-plus, Casual, Domino) Del handled the majority of production on this album. By staying true to himself, Del has earned legions of adoring fans. He may have said it best in his classic, Mistadobalina when he declared all in the mind and the heart.

The band consists of Jeanne Mackey, Tom Voiles, Linda Teaman, and Laz Slomovits. The name Harmony Bones comes from an acupuncture point that harmonizes imbalances and promotes clear thinking, seeing, and hearing.\nJeanne, Tom, Linda and Laz have joined forces to explore a wide range of traditional, contemporary and original folk songs. Rich vocal harmonies and an array of instruments -- guitar, mandolin, flute, pennywhistle, fiddle, banjo, percussion, sitar -- combine to make Harmony Bones.\nSinger/songwriter Jeanne Mackey offers a blend of emotional intensity, wry humor, and global consciousness. In addition to original tunes, her repertoire ranges from Dar Williams to Patsy Cline, from Pete Seeger to Irving Berlin. A seasoned guitarist, she draws on a variety of styles -- folk, classic swing, funky blues, and more -- with the occasional sprinkle of mandolin, accordion, or banjo. Mackey rocked the 1970s East Coast topical music circuit as a young musician advocating feminist values and social justice.  In 2010, Mackey created \"Drop The Knife: A Memoir-in-Song,\" an evening of original songs and stories exploring the meaning of homeland, curses, death, and magic.\nLinda Teaman and Tom Voiles do much of their singing and playing with Nutshell, an Ann Arbor-based Celtic roots band. Nutshell plays for contra-dances and performs at festivals across North America.\nLinda is a singer who brings depth of understanding, warmth and sensitivity to the music. In 2005, her graduation recital for a degree in k-12 choral music had her singing in five languages, encompassing musical forms such as Irish sean nos singing and Italian and German arias by composers Purcell, Mozart and Brahms. She leads the Rudolf Steiner Community Singers, a small choir that sings uncommon Christmas and seasonal songs of celebration.  She hopes you'll forgive her classical background and that she is redeemed by her love of folk music.  In addition to vocals, she adds light percussion to the mix.\nTom consumes a well-rounded musical diet that ranges from Celtic to Indian to rock and roll. He enjoys mixing different styles while maintaining a respect for the traditions from which they spring. Tom has studied North Indian Classical music, Moroccan folk drumming and western classical flute. He has worked with performance artists, dancers, mimes and poets, including Hosain Mosavat, Gerry the Fool, Matthew Smith, ML Liebler and the Magic Poetry Band.\nLaz Slomovits is one of the twin brothers in Ann Arbor\u2019s nationally-known children\u2019s music duo, Gemini. A fine singer and multi-instrumentalist, Laz is starting his 4nd year playing music. His songs are featured in songbooks used by music teachers throughout the country, and Gemini's recordings have won numerous awards. In addition, Laz has had a notable solo career. In his solo work, Laz is best known for his powerful musical settings of the poetry of ancient Sufi mystics Rumi and Hafiz, as well as that of contemporary American poets.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1637106023218709/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Harmony Bones at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-05-13T21:00:00-04:00", "description": "Far House brings you an evening of high energy rock & roll, with a special international touring guest!\n\n\nAn Atomic Whirl (Japan)\nhttp://anatomicwhirl.com/\n\nAn Atomic Whirl mixes chaotic noise, sudden soft melodies and mathy arrangements.

Following her first Wheatland Festival in 2012, Mainville fell in love with the idea of performing her own songs on stage, which eventually inspired her 2014 gypsy swing and baroque pop debut EP, Full Steam Ahead.\n\n        Since the release of her first solo output, Olivia has forged a unique path within the Mitten scene, becoming known alongside her band, the Aquatic Troupe, for their energized, dynamic performances and their gargantuan musical talent. Olivia Mainville & the Aquatic Troupe\u2019s debut album, Maybe the Saddest Thing, releases on December 10th, 2015. Comprised of consummate young talents Mainville, Andy Fettig, Bleu Quick, Libby DeCamp, and Ian Burke\u2014 and with a special guest appearance by none other than David Bowie\u2019s bandleader and lead guitarist, Gerry Leonard \u2014their multifarious, enthusiastic delivery is sure to be a hit with listeners everywhere.\n\n        Throughout her career as a professional performing musician thus far, Olivia has toured with notable folk band Caravan of Thieves, and has collaborated with stellar Michigan artists like the Ragbirds, the Appleseed Collective, the Accidentals, and Jack and the Bear. She\u2019s also made appearances at significant festivals and venues throughout the Mitten, such as Blissfest in Harbor Springs, the Majestic in Detroit, and the Ark in Ann Arbor. Between Olivia and her band mates, the Aquatic Troupe is capable of playing 11 instruments, ranging from guitar and violin to the trumpet, accordion, and omnichord \u2013 all of which encompass their collective sound.\n\n \u201cI really love that we\u2019re growing as a band,\u201d says Olivia. \u201cWe are always exploring new styles and inviting other musicians into our live shows to lend their talents and expand our sound.

These techniques provided a source of physical and spiritual strength when devastating illness struck her family. Inspired by the Buddha\u2019s transformational teachings, she set out to learn as much as she could about who he was. By profession a librarian, Shelley immersed herself in research on the time, place, and spiritual traditions that 2500 years ago produced Prince Siddhartha, who became the Buddha. Yoga, in some form, has a role in all of these traditions. While studying yoga\u2019s history, Shelley began her own practice, which proved as transformational as Buddhist meditation.\n\nBecause she loves historical fiction, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha. Unsatisfied with what she found, she decided to write her own. Her research had sparked her curiosity about Yasodhara, the woman who became Siddhartha\u2019s wife, and she became inspired by the personal and spiritual struggles of women who knew him. She began to write the Sadhana trilogy, three novels that tell their stories.\n\nShelley hung up her black belt to practice Iyengar yoga.

Born in Trim, Co. Meath, to John Keenan, Sr. of Westmeath and the former Mary Bravender of Co. Cavan. The Keenans were a Travelling family steeped in traditional music; both Paddy's father and grandfather were uilleann pipers. Paddy himself took up the pipes at the age of ten, playing his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, when he was 14. He later played with the rest of his family in a group called The Pavees. At 17, having fallen in love with the blues, Paddy left Ireland for England and Europe, where he played blues and rock. Returning to Ireland after a few years, he began playing around Dublin with singer/keyboardist Triona Ni Dhomhnaill and singer/guitarist Micheal O Dhomhnaill. Fiddler Paddy Glackin joined the three, then flute player Matt Molloy, accordionist Tony MacMahon, and guitarist Donal Lunny. Thus was born one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, The Bothy Band. Paddy was one of the band's founding members, and his virtuosity on the pipes combined with the ferocity of his playing made him, in the opinion of many, its driving force. Bothy Band-mate Donal Lunny once described Paddy as \"the Jimi Hendrix of the pipes\".\n\nSince the breakup of The Bothy Band in 1979, Paddy has toured as a soloist, bringing the finest example of traditional Irish music and uilleann piping to audiences around the globe, performing in Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Australia, across Europe, Russia, and of course America.\n\nVisit Paddy on the web here: http://www.paddykeenan.com/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/193194074399065/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Paddy Keenan- In Concert"}, {"date": "2016-05-24T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Our very own Kristin Jonna is going head to head with a mystery guest sommelier for a Somm Slam.

Now, he issues the sharpest entry of his vision, the majestic The Blackberry Train engineered by Steve Albini (Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been an evolution,\u201d James says. \u201cThis set of songs definitely has a harder edge, but it\u2019s a continuation of the last album. The main thing for me is to not conform or compromise.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 panoramic artistry is inspired by such diverse musicians as Kurt Cobain, The Smiths, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, The Cure, The Beatles, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, and Hank Williams. His fingerprint aesthetic has earned him plaudits from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Daily News. He\u2019s earned a strong following the old fashioned way, through tirelessly touring the US, Europe and the UK, and playing bigger and bigger shows with each go around.\n\nThe Blackberry Train is an epiphanic co-mingling of aesthetics. James sought out the distinct audio stylings of Steve Albini to conjure a grungier sensibility. He welcomed the engineer\u2019s gifts for capturing music with a raw clarity, and Steve Albini\u2019s reputation for not impinging on an artist\u2019s vision. The results make for an eclectic album with fastidiously crafted songs documented in the studio with glorious purity.\n\n\u201cI like the music to have elements of the avant garde, psychedelic, and be just a little against the grain,\u201d James reveals. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about having as much emotion as possible for me, musically and lyrically. It\u2019s all about the music being cathartic, heartfelt and true.\u201d\n\nThe Blackberry Train manages to be both diverse and cohesive. The album opens invigoratingly with the jangling rocker, \u201cToo Hard\u201d and closes with the stately and aptly named folk song \u201cPeace and Stillness.\u201d Between these bookends, highlights include the rough-edged and urgently melodic \u201cUnicorn,\u201d the anthemic \u201cPeyote Coyote,\u201d and the soulful ballad \u201cPrayer.\u201d One very personal song is the winsome and reflective \u201cWaterfall\u201d which was inspired by memories of his mother.\n\nThis summer and fall James will embark on extensive tour dates in the U.S. Thinking ahead, James says: \u201cI just want to keep on going, keep working, and improving as a songwriter. I\u2019d love to feel that I realized my full potential both as a person, and as a songwriter. That feels like a great, fulfilling goal to shoot for. Making a lot of music, and striving for more depth artistically\u2013those are my goals.\u201d", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/573249992825775/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "James McCartney 6/20/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-06-21T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Capturing an irresistibly bright and uplifting sound, musical pioneer and humanitarian Michael Franti and Spearhead's globally conscious reggae pop anthems are spreading some much appreciated positivity worldwide.

That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.

September 24 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nThe Slackers are self styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll from New York City. The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-09-26T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Where song, spirit, and speaking meet.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-10-21T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Two nights with Steppin' in It's fast-rising lead vocalist", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1668844700041158/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 1"}, {"date": "2016-10-22T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 2", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/215744518775574/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-10-23T19:30:00-04:00", "description": "Michigan's bluegrass and Americana success story", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1696673723915750/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys"}]
