By inclination a voracious reader and by profession a librarian, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha . When she didn\u2019t find one that satisfied her, she had the notion to write her own based on the spiritual struggles of women in the Buddha\u2019s time, set in the fascinating world that gave birth to yoga and Buddhism. Steeped in India\u2019s myths and legends, this novel is fresh territory for Western readers of fantasy and historical epics. Through its strong female characters, it will appeal to readers of historical fiction with a woman\u2019s perspective. Light refreshments. Signing to follow.\n\nMore about the book:\nA beautiful warrior princess. A tormented prince. A terrible choice between love, duty, and spiritual freedom.\n\nRebellious Dhara runs away from her Himalayan clan to study with the powerful yogi Mala, a mysterious woman with a violent past. Flung by war onto an adventure-filled journey, Dhara meets and captures the heart of Siddhartha, whose skill in the martial arts and extraordinary mental powers equal her own.\n \nWorldly power and pleasure seduce Dhara, creating a chasm between her and her husband, who longs to follow a sage\u2019s solitary path. She takes on the warrior\u2019s role Siddhartha does not want, and when she returns wounded from battle court intrigue drives them further apart. As Siddhartha\u2019s discontent with royal life intensifies, Dhara\u2019s guru Mala, who has returned to her life as a ruthless outlaw queen, seeks her former pupil for her own evil purposes. \n \nDhara\u2019s and Siddhartha\u2019s love keeps evil at bay, but their son\u2019s birth brings on a spiritual crisis for the prince.  If he leaves his kingdom to seek enlightenment, he turns his back on love and duty and risks destroying his people.

In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.  www.tomchapin.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1093572227425292/", "name": "Tom Chapin at Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2017-03-03T21:00:00-05:00", "description": "SUBSONNIK INVITES YOU !!!\nCelebrate our Record Release Party with Us bringing you the best entertainment to kick off your weekend! \nHosted at Club Above, Ann Arbor, expect to hear a dynamic range of genres, Open kitchen and Drink Specials served all night long.\n\n--- L i n e U p ---\nVest And Tyler\nhttps://soundcloud.com/vestandtyler\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/glitch/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/vestandtyler/\n\nCurtis Wolfe (L.O) Operator of Statik Records   \n[b2b] Mushkilla\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LODeepHouseMusic/\nhttp://popmuzik.se/2016/02/dj-l-o-not-without-my-coffee/\nhttps://www.beatport.com/artist/l-o/465288\nhttps://soundcloud.com/mushkilla\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DJMushkilla/\n\nTek - Mazter\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tek-mazter\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tek.mazter/\n\nQUENAUDON [b2b] Dan Ryan\nhttps://soundcloud.com/itsquenaudon\nhttps://soundcloud.com/quenaudon-remixs\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Quenaudon/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheRealDanRyan/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/apollo-671613041\n\nCody Popov (CHERRYZ)\nfacebook.com/cody.popov.5\nsoundcloud.com/cherryzofficial\n\nGrab your tickets at the door!!!\n$5 (21+)\n$7 (18+)\n\nSponsored By: SUBSONNIK and Statik Records\nwww.wearesubsonnik.com\nhttp://statikrecords.com/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/657765481078555/", "name": "Subsonnik Takeover", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2017-03-04T10:00:00-05:00", "description": "In honor of Women's History Month, Vault of Midnight will be donating the profits from sales of the amazing Bitch Planet Vol. 1 to Planned Parenthood for the entire month of March. \n\nHave you read Bitch Planet?

Nelson Doughty, age thirteen, social outcast and overachiever, is the Bugler, sounding the reveille proudly each morning. Yet this particular summer marks the beginning of an uncertain and tenuous friendship with a popular boy named Jonathan. Over the years, Nelson, irrevocably scarred from the Vietnam War, becomes Scoutmaster of Camp Chippewa, while Jonathan marries, divorces, and turns his father\u2019s business into a highly profitable company. And when something unthinkable happens at a camp get-together with Nelson as Scoutmaster and Jonathan\u2019s teenage grandson and daughter-in-law as campers, the aftermath demonstrates the depths\u2014and the limits\u2014of Nelson\u2019s selflessness and bravery. The Hearts of Men is a sweeping, panoramic novel about the slippery definitions of good and evil, family and fidelity, the challenges and rewards of lifelong friendships, the bounds of morality\u2014and redemption.\n\n\"Like a great campfire story, The Hearts of Men is epic and hushed in the right places, simultaneously local and universal, and brilliantly, beautifully unspooled.

Why is it that we read? Is it to pass time? To learn something new? To escape from reality? For Will Schwalbe, reading is a way to entertain himself but also to make sense of the world, to become a better person, and to find the answers to the big (and small) questions about how to live his life. In this delightful celebration of reading, Schwalbe invites us along on his quest for books that speak to the specific challenges of living in our modern world, with all its noise and distractions. In each chapter, he discusses a particular book\u2014what brought him to it (or vice versa), the people in his life he associates with it, and how it became a part of his understanding of himself in the world.  These books span centuries and genres (from classic works of adult and children\u2019s literature to contemporary thrillers and even cookbooks), and each one relates to the questions and concerns we all share. Throughout, Schwalbe focuses on the way certain books can help us honor those we\u2019ve loved and lost, and also figure out how to live each day more fully. Rich with stories and recommendations, Books for Living is a treasure for everyone who loves books and loves to hear the answer to the question: \u201cWhat are you reading?\"\n\n\u201cBooks for Living by Will Schwalbe lives wonderfully up to its title. He offers an easy tone, sections chapter by chapter of his chosen stories and their affiliations to our own lives. He reminds me of a diviner who walks the open fields, taps, and reveals something rarely talked about, or perhaps never noticed, in one story or another, but is important. That\u2019s a thrill! I can\u2019t imagine a person who loves books not being grateful. Any season of the year, this book is a gift.\u201d \u2014Mary Oliver\n\nWill Schwalbe has worked in publishing (he\u2019s now EVP, Editorial Development and Content Innovation for Macmillan); digital media, as the founder and CEO of Cookstr.com; and as a journalist, writing for various publications, including The New York Times and the South China Morning Post.

On a cold, clear night in this remotest of towns, witness nine stories of residents falling in and out of love in the strangest of ways. Set against the hovering northern lights, hearts get broken, knees get bruised, and love is lost, found, and confounded. It\u2019s love. But not quite.\n \nThe subject of this critically acclaimed play is something that veteran director Kat Walsh sees as universal to audiences, and her direction aims to make that connection. \u201cMeaningful relationships require vulnerability --- it means allowing yourself to be fully seen and heard by another person and risking rejection. John Cariani brilliantly captures these inspiring, and yes frightening, moments in his play, Almost, Maine,\" shared director Walsh. \"Our actors and production staff have the heroic task of portraying these acts of courage on stage for an audience. We want to tell these stories simply and honestly.\u201d\n \nThe talented cast of Almost, Maine includes Andrew Benson, Elizabeth Docel, Matthew Flickinger, Chris Grimm, Lawrence Havelka, Chris Joseph, Rachael Kohl, Stephanie Laurinec, Joe Lopez, Matthew Miller, Scott Mooney, Sara Rose, Codi Sharp, Megan Shiplett, and Michelle Weiss.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1877727032438874/", "name": "Almost, Maine", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2017-03-13T00:00:00-04:00", "description": "Can't make it to Ann Arbor on March 26?

March 17 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nElectric 6\nwsg: Residual Kid & PALACES\n\nEternal life can seem like an eternity. Ask any vampire. The continuous march of sun ups, sun downs, transformations of form, seductions, cape fittings & exsanguinations. Eventually it all just becomes an endless, tired routine. It all seems so exciting & so sexy to those of us who operate knowing we have limited time. But ask any vampire about the downside of eternal life, & you won't be surprised to hear tales of binge eating garlic bread just to feel the hurt, or of the occasional dangling of a wooden stake just over the center of the rib cage. Electric Six knows all about eternal life. Electric Six has been around forever & it can never die. That's lovely, but it's also very tiring. Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres is the new release by Electric Six on Metropolis Records. One listen & you will immediately understand that the sexiest vampires are urban vampires. Where E6 has dabbled in dance, hip-hop & R&B in the past, Fresh Blood is the whole enchilada. It's thirteen songs designed to make the listener interested in smooth & nasty fuckin', the way they do it in the city. From the Grandmaster Flash-inspired Number Of The Beast to the super smooth tour of the NYC outer boroughs Mood Is Improving, the listener finds himself immediately deposited into an urban drop zone with hustlas & dickblockas coming from behind every corner. The radio-ready pop hits I'll Be In Touch & Dance With Dark Forces are the tracks that get the listener off the street & into the club. & it would not be an Electric Six album without an epic closer, that being the beautiful & haunting Spacewalkin', the ballad that assures the listener that the vampire has now fed & will live a thousand more years, albeit in outer space. Electric Six changes more frequently than change itself, but ultimately this just means they're never gonna put out the same album twice. Fresh Blood for Tired Vampires is poppy & smooth, nasty & raw...& oh so life affirming, especially if you are undead", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1798409430410398/", "name": "Electric 6 - 3/17/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2017-03-17T22:00:00-04:00", "description": "Laugh as our League and guests tackle long form improv with their hilarious skills.

Often, the cinematic image stands in for real life as it plays out behind windows in the buildings, sometimes creating a sense of mystery, other times stressing the mundane. Snelling\u2019s work derives from voyeurism, film noir, and geographical and architectural location. Within this idea of location, themes develop that transport observation into the realm of storytelling, with reality and sociological study being the focus. Snelling had exhibited in international galleries, museums and institutions, including the The Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Belgium; Palazzo Reale, Milan; Museum of Arts and Design, New York; Kunstmuseen Krefeld Germany; El Museo de Arte de Banco de la Republica, Bogota; the Stenersen Museet, Oslo, and the Sundance Film Festival. Her short films have screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, Circuito Off in Venice, Italy, and the Arquiteturas Film Festival Lisboa in Portugal.

The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vige\u0301e Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d.

The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vige\u0301e Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d.

April 15 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nProtomartyr  \nwsg: Paint Thinner & Double Winter\n\nI asked Joe Casey once why he chose to start his first band with a group of guys roughly ten years his junior. His answer was simple: He needed them, needed this, needed Protomartyr. He didn\u2019t want to end up singing classic rock covers in a carport or dive bar one night a week. At 35, with no musical background and crippling stage fright, he needed friends who were young and hearty enough to want to write and record and practice and tour and be heard as badly as he did then. He\u2019d just lost his father to an unexpected heart attack, and his heartbroken mother to the beginnings of Alzheimer\u2019s shortly thereafter. He\u2019d come to understand, all too intimately, how brutal and finite a life can be. Consider then the urgency with which he joined his bandmates\u2014guitarist Greg Ahee, drummer Alex Leonard, and bassist Scott Davidson, fellow alums of the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy\u2014for the first time, in a basement full of unsuspecting onlookers. Consider the urgency with which they\u2019ve approached everything since\u2014three albums in three years, each more extraordinary and rewarding than the last. This music is inherently, unassumingly high stakes. I can think of no other band that moves me like they do.\n\nThis October marks the release of The Agent Intellect, their third and finest work to date.  Named after an ancient philosophical questioning of how the mind operates in relation to the self, it\u2019s an elegant and often devastating display of all that makes Protomartyr so vital and singularly visceral an outfit. Over the course of several months, Ahee waded through more than a hundred song fragments until he reached the bottomless melodies of \u201cI Forgive You\u201d and \u201cClandestine Time\u201d, the inky depths of \u201cPontiac \u201987\u201d and titanic churn of \u201cWhy Does It Shake?\u201d Lyrically, Casey is at his most confident and haunting. He humanizes evil on \u201cThe Devil in His Youth,\u201d and, amid the charred pop of \u201cDope Cloud,\u201d he reassures us that nothing\u2014not God, not money\u2014can or will prevent our minds from unraveling until we finally fade away. We are no one and nothing, he claims, without our thoughts. It\u2019s a theme that echoes through the entirety of the record, but never as beautifully as it does on \u201cEllen.\u201d Named after his mother and written from the perspective of his late father, it\u2019s as romantic a song as you\u2019re likely to hear this or any year, Casey promising to wait for her on the other side, with the memories she\u2019s lost safely in hand.\n\nI remember a story he told me in Detroit. A few months earlier, he\u2019d been driving with his mother as a Protomartyr recording played on the stereo.\n\n\u201cJoe,\u201d she asked him. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is us, Mom,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said, \u201cThis is very good.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014David Bevan, July 2015", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/360856157630319/", "name": "Protomartyr 4/15/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2017-04-16T12:00:00-04:00", "description": "March 11\u2013August 20, 2017\nPhotography Gallery\n\nIn 2013, artist Ernestine Ruben (BSDEs \u201953) photographed the once-famed industrial complex Willow Run in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II.\nFor this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body\u2019s interior landscape.

Austin(TX), Portland(ME), Indianapolis(IN), Seattle (WA), Sydney (AU) are just a few of the cities who have announced solidarity marches. And there are MANY others who are in the initial planning stages around our country and the world.\n\nFor those who can not attend the March in DC, we URGE all our community members, their families, friends, and allies to reach out to their local Pride organizations to help coordinate additional solidarity marches. Use these organizations to help bring your local communities together. The issues that face our community are not just national, but local as well. \n\nIn short time, we will start linking all the pop-up solidarity marches to this main event page, as well as a web page that will be created with more information on all the marches.\n\nLet\u2019s make this truly a \u201cNational Pride March\u201d that spreads from coast to coast and shows solidarity through our Pride movement.
