At their summits were a select few\u2014kings and chiefs whose authority was derived from their direct connection to powerful ancestors and predecessors. These rulers were wrapped in expensive textiles or costly furs, and covered in beads and precious metals, materials that not only signaled their extraordinary status, but were also intended to safely contain the great power they wielded. The famous minkisi (meaning \u201cpower figure\u201d) sculptures of Central Africa were similarly activated through the addition of charged materials. Textiles, animal skin, metal, and beads allowed the lifeless wooden carvings to be activated by local spiritual leaders in order to communicate with the realm of the ancestors and spirits. This exhibition explores the parallels between the adornment of the king\u2019s physical body and minkisi. Drawing on works from UMMA\u2019s collection and several loans, the exhibition demonstrates how authority was expressed and power contained across a range of historical cultures in Nigeria, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon.\n\nLead support for Power Contained: The Art of Authority in Central and West Africa is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the African Studies Center."}, {"date": "2017-08-19T11:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/117418778916099/", "name": "Hatch Chile Bacon Havarti Burger Pop-up", "description": "It's Hatch Chile season, and they've found their way into our all natural burgers, along with Havarti cheese and our famous bacon. $5 a burger- grab one to go, or enjoy with a beer outside on our patio."}, {"date": "2017-08-19T13:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/154904088382130/", "name": "Ann Arbor Blues Festival", "description": "In 1969, the Blues threw a party, and everybody came.

These songs come from the soul and etch themselves into your fabric.\u201d\n\nA songwriter\u2019s songwriter, Josh Rose, grew up in the northern woodlands and fine tuned his songwriting in the borderlands. He has spent the past ten years touring the midwest, teaching, writing, and building a rich body of highly respected work. Josh is the type of writer who labors over every word, creating songs that get injected into the listener's permanent being. After his two previous studio albums, Firework Letdown and Slow Bloom, Josh is more than pleased to bring you his latest work, Old Laminate, featuring 12 well-crafted poignant songs that forge much, much deeper than the saccharine fare that completely dominates the automatic, entitled-consumer, popular music world of our day. \n\nThis music is much like a memorable meal: mood-evoking, fresh, and necessary. \n\nJUDY BANKER\n\n \u201cJudy Banker is emerging as a premier songwriter with universal appeal.

With a voice WXOU\u2019s \u201cThe Old Front Porch Radio Show\u201d host Maggie Ferguson describes as \u201ctangy and bright as fall cider\u201d, Judy takes cues from artists like Loretta Lynn to Gillian Welch, with intensely personal songwriting, sharing warm love songs, lamentations, and narratives reflecting on universal themes drawn from her own deep and rich life experiences.

Crafted from the heart, Ed\u2019s music flows from an array of broad social themes to more personal narratives of love and loss. Rooted in both realism and idealism, Ed's musical goal is deeper inquiry and exploration for himself and his listeners.

Kitson, translator for the novel Rapture by Iliazd\n\nAbout Rapture\nThe draft dodger Laurence yearns to take control of his destiny. Having fled to the highlands, he asserts his independence by committing a string of robberies and murders. Then he happens upon Ivlita, a beautiful young woman trapped in an intricately carved mahogany house. Laurence does not hesitate to take her as well. Determined to drape his young bride in jewels, he plots ever more daring heists. Yet when Laurence finds himself casting bombs alongside members of a revolutionary cell, he must again ask: is he a free man or a pawn of history?\n\nRapture is a fast-paced adventure-romance and a literary treat of the highest order. The author, Iliazd, entertains, with a deceptively light hand, questions that James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann once faced. How does the individual balance freedom and necessity, love and death, creativity and sterility? What is the role of violence in human history and culture? How does language both comfort and fail us in our postwar, post-Christian world?\n\nCensored for decades in the Soviet Union, Rapture was a novel nearly lost to Russian and Western audiences. This English-language translation rescues Laurence's surreal journey from the oblivion he, too, faces as he as he tries to outrun fate.\n\nThomas J.

He writes songs that blend the roots of American music with gritty rock n\u2019 roll and vintage soul. Performing Songwriter Magazine called the result, \"Some of the liveliest and most rocking roots music around. \nFor over 15 years Joshua has made his living sharing his songs, stories and knowledge across the US and Canada at festivals, concert halls, coffeehouses and dives \u2013 as a solo act, front man for roots ensemble \"Steppin\u2019 In It\", classic swing band \"Shout Sister Shout\", songwriter showcase band \"The Starlight Six\" and frequently as a workshop facilitator, presenter or instructor. \nHis music is steeped in ragtime blues, sweet jazz and real country but Davis\u2019s broad schooling in the cultural, political and musical roots of American tradition has resulted in more than a simple retelling of universal themes. Dubbed, \"the Michigan version of the Great American Songscape\" (Chris Reitz, Elderly Instruments), his catalog is a seamless snapshot of American past and present. Joshua has shared stages with a diverse list of luminaries, such as Tim O\u2019Brien, Greg Brown, The Indigo Girls, Leftover Salmon, The Dixie Hummingbirds, Corey Harris, John Gorka, Jeff Daniels, Ellis Paul, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Jimmy LaFave, Ray Bonneville, Arlo Guthrie, Abigail Washburn, Larry McCray, Sunny Wilkinson, Catie Curtis, Bill Kirchen, Peter \"Madcat\" Ruth, Bernie Leadon, Wayne Hancock, The Verve Pipe, John Hammond, Pete Seeger and Preservation Hall Jazz Band.  Davis has released three critically acclaimed solo albums, five albums with Steppin\u2019 In It, a record of jazz standards with Shout Sister Shout, and has appeared on too many albums to count. His most recent album, \"A Miracle of Birds\" is inspired by his travels in the Palestinian West Bank with non-profit organization On the Ground. About the album, Revue magazine says, \"His heartfelt documentation of 'people as people' offers up compassionate songs of hope, darkness and perseverance.\" \n\nJoshua has performed live on the internationally syndicated programs Mountain Stage, Woodsongs Old-Time Radio Hour and Backstage Pass. His songs have been featured on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered, Folk Alley and The Mix and he has played scores of prestigious festivals and venues not to mention every festival Michigan has to offer."}, {"date": "2017-08-24T18:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/106525593380891/", "name": "Wine Tasting", "description": "August is Old World Wine Month for our Wine Club, and we're opening up this wine tasting to the public!\n\nWe are featuring back to the future Italy, old wine varietals that you should drink today.

Walker (lighting design).\n\nThis grand and dream-tweaked comedy is about violence and legacy, art and activism, feminism and terrorism, compatriots and chosen sisters, and how we actually go about changing the world.

I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her, but she is still there, somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body, one that I barely recognized or understood, but at least I was safe.\u201d \n \nNew York Times bestselling author Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and bodies, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as \u201cwildly undisciplined,\u201d Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she casts an insightful and critical eye on her childhood, teens, and twenties\u2014including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life\u2014and brings readers into the present and the realities, pains, and joys of her daily life. \n \nWith the bracing candor, vulnerability, and authority that have made her one of the most admired voices of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to be overweight in a time when the bigger you are, the less you are seen. Hunger is a deeply personal memoir from one of our finest writers, and tells a story that hasn\u2019t yet been told but needs to be.  \n---\nAbout LezRead\nLezRead is Ann Arbor's premier book club for lesbians.

Hailing from across the country, DSQ is named for legendary University of Michigan Saxophone Professor Donald Sinta, the group's mentor. \n\nDSQ have distinguished themselves on the competition circuit, making history by being the first saxophone quartet ever to win the Elmaleh 1st Prize in the Concert Artists Guild International Competition in NYC, having been chosen by a unanimous vote of the jury. The group also received the Alice Coleman Grand Prize at the 2013 Coleman International Competition in Los Angeles, and 1st Prize at the North American Alliance Saxophone Quartet Competition in Arizona. Upcoming performances include recitals at Market Square Concerts, Chamber Music Society of Detroit, University of Delaware, Kravis Center in West Palm Beach, St. Bonaventure University, a concerto performance in Strasbourg, France with the Paris Garde R\u00e9publicaine Band as well as multiple performances with the Reno Philharmonic in 2016.\n\nDSQ were the featured soloists with the University of Michigan Symphony Band during the historic 2011 tour through Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xian, Hangzhou, and Los Angeles. The group performed in some of the most prestigious concert halls in the world including the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing and Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Tour performances also featured DSQ at the Shanghai Conservatory, Hanban Headquarters, as well as a performance for the students of the Youth Orchestras of Los Angeles. Their concerto performances featured the world premiere of Pulitzer Prize winning composer William Bolcom\u2019s Concerto Grosso for Saxophone Quartet and Band. In addition to their China tour performances, DSQ have also performed this work with the Dallas Wind Symphony in Texas. They can be heard performing this work on the Michigan Symphony Band\u2019s recording Artifacts. Recent reviews of the recording praised the quartet as, \u201cImmensely entertaining..Really superb musicians! (Audiophile Audition),\u201d and, \u201cThe highlight of the album\u2026(American Record Guide).\u201d\n\nFollowing their performances in China, DSQ maintained a national and international touring schedule with recitals at the 16th World Saxophone Congress in St. Andrews, Scotland; Thessaloniki, Greece for the 2012 International Society for Music Education Conference; a 2013 tour through Paris with recital/clinics at the Paris Conservatory, Versailles Conservatory, and Selmer Paris showroom; and performances in Geneva and Montreux, Switzerland at CERN and the Montreux International Jazz Festival.

DSQ have also made radio appearances on New York\u2019s WQXR and Interlochen Public Radio, and have been featured frequently on American Public Media\u2019s Performance Today.\n\nEqually committed to education and community engagement, the quartet has presented clinics and performances at numerous colleges and universities including the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, SUNY-Potsdam\u2019s Crane School of Music, as well as a residency at Grand Valley State University. DSQ have also presented workshops and performances at Saline High School (MI), public schools and universities in Dallas as part of a residency with the Dallas Wind Symphony (TX), and two tours through the Wappingers Central School District (NY).\n\nDSQ\u2019s repertoire spans centuries and encompasses the great string quartet repertoire of Dvorak, Schubert, and Shostakovich, as well as numerous saxophone standards and several new commissions and premieres by today\u2019s emerging young composers. To this end, DSQ has initiated an annual National Saxophone Quartet Composition Competition for new music from student composers. DSQ are managed by Concert Artists Guild (www.concertartists.org) and are Selmer-Paris Artists, performing on Selmer Paris Saxophones exclusively."}, {"date": "2017-08-26T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/127297771213779/", "name": "Pointless Improv with Poppin' Buttons and Lady Parts", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Mysterious Puppy \nGroup 2: Lady Parts\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers"}, {"date": "2017-08-26T21:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/163400304225737/", "name": "The Macpodz at the Blind Pig ", "description": "Celebrating birthdays and our favorite rock club the Blind Pig and celebrating things which we're not even allowed to tell you about yet."}, {"date": "2017-08-26T22:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/148220382424787/", "name": "Pointless Improv with Lady Parts and Poppin' Buttons", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Lady Parts\nGroup 2: Mysterious Puppy \nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers"}, {"date": "2017-08-27T14:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/655522174654073/", "name": "Victors for Art: Michigan\u2019s Alumni Collectors\u2014Part II", "description": "Guided Tour\nCommemorating the University of Michigan\u2019s 2017 Bicentennial, Victors for Art: Michigan\u2019s Alumni Collectors celebrates the deep impact of Michigan alumni on the global art world.

Susan has sung with Paul Keller's big band since 1991 when she was a waitress at the Bird of Paradise jazz club. Susan went on to do extraordinary things for the jazz community as owner of Ann Arbor's famous Firefly Club. For ten years, the Firefly Club presented top-quality jazz and blues seven nights a week. Susan's vision, dedication and tireless efforts made the Firefly Club a well-loved destination for jazz musicians and jazz fans alike. The Firefly Club hosted a myriad of jazz and blues talent including Benny Golson, Monty Alexander, Jeff Hamiton, David \"Fathead\" Newman, Mulgrew Miller, Danilo Perez, Mose Allison, Greg Osby, Dave Liebman, Mose Allison, Patricia Barber, Janis Siegel, Big Bill Morganfield, Elmore James, Jr., Alvin Youngblood Heart, Tim Ries, Barbara Morrison, Kermit Ruffins, Mark Elf, Roseanna Vitro, The Clayton Brothers, Eric Reed, Maria Muldaur, Brian Auger, Johnny Varro, David Sanchez, Tierney Sutton, and Karrin Allyson. Even more importantly, Susan and the Firefly Club provided a home for the many local jazz musicians to who thrived there thanks to her generosity and nurturing. Sadly, the Firefly Club closed its doors permanently in August of 2009.\n\nNow, Susan splits her time between Ann Arbor, MI and St. Augustine, FL where she can be near her grandson Atreyu. Susan Chastain remains a valued member of the Paul Keller Orchestra (which plays every Monday night at Zal Gaz Grotto), and Paul Klinger's Easy Street Jazz Band (which plays every Tuesday from 5:30 till 8:30 at Zal Gaz Grotto in Ann Arbor for the popular Dixieland Happy Hour). She has accompanied the PKO on their two European tours and appears on five of their CDs (www.pkorecords.com), and she appears on all four of the Easy Street Jazz Band CDs. Susan has performed at all of the Michigan-area jazz festivals. Susan is featured prominently on her 2005 CD \u201cSteady Gig\u201d with the Paul Keller Ensemble. On \u201cSteady Gig,\u201d Susan sings 11 of her favorite standards with memorable musical arrangements by Keller. Susan's rich alto voice, relaxed style and personal warmth shine throughout this recording. Her newest venture is a non-profit organization called The Jazz Greenhouse, which focuses on jazz education for young musicians, and presenting jazz in non-traditional venues for the benefit of the community, with special emphasis on children and senior citizens."}, {"date": "2017-08-27T16:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/256786084839722/", "name": "Beer and Board Games", "description": "Come in out of the rain/sunshine/snow/tornado/weird-Michigan-weather and play board games while enjoying brewed-on-site craft beer! \nBring your own games or use ours. \nBrings some friends or meet some new ones. \nSundays at 4pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre, 3014 Packard in Ann Arbor."}, {"date": "2017-08-27T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/149997122211288/", "name": "God Module : Does this Stuff Freak You Out?

He is currently a Lecturer in writing, rhetoric, and cultural studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nIn One Version of the Story is a lyric exploration of the ways human beings confront desire, loss and absence by creating stories. Its narrative situation begins with from the French folk legend of \u201cl\u2019Inconnue de la Seine\u201d\u2014the unidentified young woman who drowned herself in Paris in the 1880s, and whose (unauthorized) death mask was eventually cast as the face of Resusci-Anne CPR training dummies\u2014but eventually the book encompasses a chronicle of personal loss, a history of photography, a study of the mechanics of breathing, and a solo climb to the rim of a Mediterranean volcano.\n\nThe book is a hybrid of narrative history, lyric meditation, and journalistic investigation, often implicating the speaker (and reader) in the act of mythmaking itself. It is story-making itself which is interrogated here, however the book seeks not to recreate narratives, but rather to understand why they matter\u2014why and how we give them the meaning that we do.\n\n*\n\nSusanna Lang was born in New York and raised in college towns where her father taught in Kansas, Michigan and Connecticut. Her first collection of poems, Even Now, was published by The Backwaters Press in 2008, and her chapbook, Two by Two, came out with Finishing Line Press in 2011. A full-length collection, Tracing the Lines, was published by Brick Road Poetry Press in spring 2013. Words in Stone, her translation of poems by Yves Bonnefoy, was published by the University of Massachusetts Press in 1976; The Origin of Language, prose poems by Yves Bonnefoy, was published by George Nama in 1979.

The result is a collection of double images: the moon a \u201ccopper coin with the sheen worn off,\u201d \u201cthe flag [that] slips down the pole,\u201d the country where her grandmother was born once called Russia, now Ukraine. As clear in its language as it is rich in argument, there\u2019s something for everyone in Travel Notes, for travelers are exactly what this poet proclaims we are. It\u2019s impossible to read this collection without wondering what doubles wait/lurk/reside beneath the skin of our bodies and of our world.\n             \u2014Andrew McFadyen-Ketchum"}, {"date": "2017-08-28T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1414498181967708/", "name": "Straight Up | Featuring Natalie Berry & Trevor Stone", "description": "After Intermural's Happy Hour at the Art Center (5 to 7pm) come join us at Alley Bar for August's Straight Up!

Even the Upper Peninsula itself has been omitted from maps, creating a people and a place that have become in many ways \u201cungeographic.\u201d These people and this place are strongly made up of traditionally marginalized groups such as the working class, the rural poor, and Native Americans, which adds even more insult to the exclusion and forced oppressive silence.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, the Rainbow Seekers could illuminate the very chambers of Heaven. Lead singer Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.\n\nThe Rainbow Seekers began their quest beneath the fingertips of songwriter Joe Hertler. Bassist and producer Kevin Pritchard, recently thawed from an extremely rare prehistoric groove glacier, discovered the forlorn Hertler in a twinkling, mysteriously fortuitous place called The Quilted Attic. Alongside legendary glacier-hunter Rick Hale\u2014who would later spend decades forging a drumset from pure, white-hot, ancient stardust to mark the occasion\u2014Pritchard changed the world: He wrangled Hertler into musical collaboration. And the lonely little songsmith, it turned out, was not quite as alone as he seemed: With him came the irresistibly sexy blues guitar prodigy who is now known to the world as Ryan Hoger.\n\nThe core of the Rainbow was thereby established, and it didn\u2019t take long for the Rainbow Seekers to continue their expansion. Multi-instrumentalist and notable auxiliary percussion maestro Micah Bracken journeyed from the bowels of Atlantis when he heard tell of the Rainbow, and the earth trembled as saxophonist and all-around bad ass Aaron Stinson descended from Olympus on a golden rainbow of his own. Then came Stinson's little-known winged companion from the Far East, the debonair violist Joshua Barber Holcomb\u2014When he saw the pure, unadulterated joy the Rainbow Seekers sprinkled on every crowd they happened upon, he had no choice but to join them on their quest. As you'll know if you've seen the band, seeking the proverbial Rainbow is all about the live performance. \"The live show is the purpose of the band. This is why we make music. Playing music is a symbiotic process, and without a crowd it is just a bunch of guys jamming,\" says Hertler. \"We believe that performance is not a High Art operation, and that you should do anything you can to ensure that the crowd is having a good time. From pi\u00f1atas to confetti, to fog, to flowers, to drum solos, to strobe lights, to Thor, to sword battles\u2014literally anything goes.\"  If you're still reading this, at least one thing is true: The Rainbow Seekers have been waiting for you. If you'll only let them, they will shake the dust from your wildest expectations. They will roar into your life with rapturous frequencies, exuberant tone, and a joyfulness of purpose that has truly become a rare sight on stage. Join them in their celebration, and they will take you on a never-ending journey to a place you'll never be able to describe in words."}, {"date": "2017-08-31T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/118227762130905/", "name": "Ghastly at Necto", "description": "React Detroit presents...\n\n:: Ghastly ::\nWelcome Week Bash\n\nSupport by:\nMielo\n\nNecto Nightclub\n516 E.

Born in Trim, Co. Meath, to John Keenan, Sr. of Westmeath and the former Mary Bravender of Co. Cavan. The Keenans were a Travelling family steeped in traditional music; both Paddy's father and grandfather were uilleann pipers. Paddy himself took up the pipes at the age of ten, playing his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, when he was 14. He later played with the rest of his family in a group called The Pavees. At 17, having fallen in love with the blues, Paddy left Ireland for England and Europe, where he played blues and rock. Returning to Ireland after a few years, he began playing around Dublin with singer/keyboardist Triona Ni Dhomhnaill and singer/guitarist Micheal O Dhomhnaill. Fiddler Paddy Glackin joined the three, then flute player Matt Molloy, accordionist Tony MacMahon, and guitarist Donal Lunny. Thus was born one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, The Bothy Band. Paddy was one of the band's founding members, and his virtuosity on the pipes combined with the ferocity of his playing made him, in the opinion of many, its driving force. Bothy Band-mate Donal Lunny once described Paddy as \"the Jimi Hendrix of the pipes\".\n\nSince the breakup of The Bothy Band in 1979, Paddy has toured as a soloist, bringing the finest example of traditional Irish music and uilleann piping to audiences around the globe, performing in Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Australia, across Europe, Russia, and of course America.\n\nVisit Paddy on the web here: http://www.paddykeenan.com/"}, {"date": "2017-09-03T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/2029026593999967/", "name": "Open Mic and Feature: Marlin Jenkins and Monica Rico", "description": "Marlin M.

Yet even as Democrats swooned, a small cadre of Republican operatives, including Karl Rove, Ed Gillespie, and Chris Jankowski began plotting their comeback with a simple yet ingenious plan. These men had devised a way to take a tradition of dirty tricks\u2014known to political insiders as \u201cratf**king\u201d\u2014to a whole new, unprecedented level. Flooding state races with a gold rush of dark money made possible by Citizens United, the Republicans reshaped state legislatures, where the power to redistrict is held. Reconstructing this never- told-before story, David Daley examines the far-reaching effects of this so-called REDMAP program, which has radically altered America\u2019s electoral map and created a firewall in the House, insulating the party and its wealthy donors from popular democracy.

The Upper Peninsula of Michigan\u2014known as \"the UP\"\u2014is historically, geographically, and culturally distinct. Struggles over land, labor, and language during the last 150 years have shaped the variety of English spoken by resident Yoopers, as well as how they are viewed by outsiders.\n\nDrawing on sixteen years of fieldwork, including interviews with seventy-five lifelong residents of the UP, Kathryn Remlinger examines how the idea of a unique Yooper dialect emerged. Considering UP English in relation to other regional dialects and their speakers, she looks at local identity, literacy practices, media representations, language attitudes, notions of authenticity, economic factors, tourism, and contact with immigrant and Native American languages. The book also explores how a dialect becomes a recognizable and valuable commodity: Yooper talk (or \"Yoopanese\") is emblazoned on t-shirts, flags, postcards, coffee mugs, and bumper stickers.\n\nYooper Talk explains linguistic concepts with entertaining examples for general readers and also contributes to interdisciplinary discussions of dialect and identity in sociolinguistics, anthropology, dialectology, and folklore.\n\n\"Although humorous songs poke fun at Yoopers' words and customs, Remlinger takes this place and its people very seriously. She explains how history, ethnicity, environment, economic changes, tourism, and especially language have created a colorful and distinctive regional dialect and identity.\" \u2014Larry Lankton,Hollowed Ground: Copper Mining and Community Building on Lake Superior\n\nKathryn A.

In this one-act play, song, dialogue and dance are used to tell the story of how the American hero Kilroy enters the pantheon of heroes by losing his innocence. The plaza of Ten Blocks on the Camino Real is a crossroads of world theater, drawing on Williams\u2019 experiences in Mexico, and inspired by German theater, Chinese opera and commedia del\u2019arte. Ghana is the source and setting for this new production, directed by David Kaplan, curator of the Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theater Festival. While the spoken English text is performed as written by Williams, Spanish songs and Spanish words have been translated to Ghanaian songs and Ghanaian languages. Don Quixote has become Okomfo Okokye, the founder of the Ashanti line of kings, who finds his sidekick, Osei-tutu. Other Spanish details are exchanged for Ghanaian specifics: pesos for pesewas, fiesta for jubilee. The presiding musician plays two blue djembe drums, rather than a blue guitar.\n\nEstablished in 1983 at the University of Ghana at Legon, the professional theater company once known as \u201cAbibigromma\u201d became the resident troupe of the National Theatre of Ghana in 1991. The focus of the company is to develop a rich blend of music, dance, mime, movement, and dialogue with a strong social, spiritual and folkloric base. \n\nCWPS aims to recreate the atmosphere of the Ghanaian outdoor productions here in Michigan, staging performances in four outdoor venues through the week.

In this moving, jarring, and ultimately inspiring memoir, Saunders discusses his troubled childhood, the traumatic brain injury he suffered in 2011, and the severe depression that nearly cost him his life. As Saunders writes,\n\nPlaying Hurt is not an autobiography of a sports celebrity but a memoir of a man facing his own mental illness, and emerging better off for the effort. I will take you into the heart of my struggle with depression, including insights into some of its causes, its consequences, and its treatments.\n\nI invite you behind the facade of my apparently \"perfect\" life as a sportscaster, with a wonderful wife and two healthy, happy adult daughters. I have a lot to be thankful for, and I am truly grateful. But none of these things can protect me or anyone else from the disease of depression and its potentially lethal effects.\n\nMine is a rare story: that of a black man in the sports industry openly grappling with depression. I will share the good, the bad, and the ugly, including the lengths I've gone to to conceal my private life from the public.\n\nSo why write a book? Because I want to end the pain and heartache that comes from leading a double life. I also want to reach out to the millions of people, especially men, who think they're alone and can't ask for help.\n\nJohn Saunders died suddenly on August 10 ,2016, from an enlarged heart, diabetes, and other complications.

King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is No Other Love. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.

They\u2019re about as idiosyncratic as anything in the wide world of \u201cpopular music.\u201d They\u2019re painfully personal, yet they somehow infiltrate the souls of her listeners, no matter how different the paths they\u2019ve followed through their lives.\nSongs aren\u2019t so much written as harvested by Gauthier. Though she lives not far from the hit-making mills of Music Row, she admits to knowing nothing about how to write on command.  She says, \u201cI have to be called to write. The call comes from somewhere I don\u2019t understand, but I know it when I hear it.\u201d\nThat call first came to her a long time ago. Her life to that point had led her to extremes, plenty of negatives and a few brilliant bright spots. An adopted child who became a teenage runaway, she found her first shelter among addicts and drag queens. Eventually she achieved renown as a chef even while balancing her restaurant responsibilities with the demands of addiction to heroin.\nTwo more successful restaurants, an escalating addiction, and a subsequent arrest led her into sobriety. It was rehearsal for what was to follow, when she wrote her first song in her mid-thirties. From that point, Gauthier channeled a long line of eloquent works, including the achingly beautiful, \"Mercy Now.\" She says of her new CD, Trouble and Love, \u201cI started the process in a lot of grief. I\u2019d lost a lot. So the first batch of songs was just too sad. It was like walking too close to the fire. I had to back off from it. The truth is that when you\u2019re in the amount of grief I was in, it\u2019s an altered state. Life is not that. You go through that. We human beings have this built-in healing mechanism that\u2019s always pushing us toward life. I didn\u2019t want to write just darkness, because that\u2019s not the truth. I had to write through the darkness to get to the truth. Writing helped me back onto my feet again. This record is about getting to a new normal. It\u2019s a transformation record.\u201d We are so pleased to welcome Mary Gauthier into our Series.\nmarygauthier.com"}, {"date": "2017-10-28T12:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/333454157089137/", "name": "Poto Singlespeed World Championship", "description": "The PSSWC is an unsupported group ride around the Potawatomi Trail.

With lyrical depth drawing comparisons to Leonard Cohen, Townes Van Zandt, and Dave Carter, Schmidt is an artist whose earthy poetry conjures magic from the mundane.\n\nArmed with voice, acoustic guitar, and acute commentary, Schmidt is an authentic timeless troubadour, one man sharing his truth in song unadorned and intimate. Danny's writing is diverse, from deeply-rooted Appalachian mountain gospel to haunted English balladry; from syncopated Piedmont country blues to vagabond 60's protest folk.  Danny tackles themes of love, loss, and longing; restless discontent; and grateful joy. He captures the sorrow and the beauty inherent in our everyday lives with the wisdom of a perceptive, compassionate elder and the innocent awe and tenderness of a child. \n\nFollowing his self-released Parables & Primes, Schmidt's 2007 release, Little Grey Sheep, began a streak of albums that charted at #1 on the folk radio charts internationally. After receiving a Kerrville New Folk award, Schmidt won the notice of venerable Americana roots label, Red House Records, which began releasing his albums in 2009.\n\nSchmidt released three albums on Red House, including Instead The Forest Rose To Sing; the spare and intimate Man Of Many Moons; and,  with his partner, Carrie Elkin, the amorous duo album, For Keeps.

After absorbing late 90's club life in New York, London, and Los Angeles, Christian settled in San Francisco in the spring of 2000.

Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray.
