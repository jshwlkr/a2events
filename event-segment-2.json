The low-resolution LEDs create a tension between representation and abstraction, provoking viewers to interpret visual information on their own. In the three-channel video, It\u2019s My Island, Laitinen builds his own island in the Baltic Sea by dragging two hundred sand bags into the water over a period of three months. The work explores ideas of nationality, citizenship, and identity as the artist creates his own single-citizen micro-nation. Lemercier\u2019s computer-generated print Landform uses patterns of black dots and projected light to create the illusion of three-dimensionality and movement when seen from a distance. The effects are more realistic than a still image, butstill unsettlingly artificial. Silva\u2019s Render Garden explores the digitized landscape, including remix and glitch aesthetics, through software that endlessly generates new plant combinations.\n\nThroughout the next year, UMMA will present three exhibitions drawn from the Borusan Contemporary Art Collection in Istanbul. The Borusan\u2019s 30-year-old collection includes significant works across a variety of genres, and since 2011 it has focused on media arts. The works exhibited here address formal concerns such as abstraction and color, and conceptual topics such as identity or ecological issues; many represent traditional categories such as portraiture and landscape that find new resonance when explored through the strategies of dynamic technology.\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by Susan and Richard Gutow Fund, the Herbert W. and Susan L.

Coleman in support of her memoir, Bipolar Faith: A Black Woman's Journey Through Depression and Faith.\n\nIn a new memoir, Coleman reflects on the legacies of slavery, poverty, war, and alcoholism, and how these conditions can mask a history of mental illness. At once spiritual autobiography and memoir of madness, Bipolar Faith is the book Dr. Coleman was hoping to find when she was diagnosed with bipolar II, a mental illness. She could not find a single memoir written about living with bipolar II, which is characterized by periods of deep depressions balanced by periods of productivity and energy. Moreover, she found precious few memoirs that engage religion and faith in truly constructive ways. \n\nWhile the taboo around depression in the African-American faith community is diminishing, \"I think there are people suffering from depression and bipolar disease who are also striving to maintain their faith. There are few guides or safe places where they can discuss their feelings,\" says Coleman. This book is for them and their allies.\n\n\u201cMonica Coleman writes with the artistry of a poetic storyteller, the intimacy of someone who has studied depression from the inside, and the courageous transparency of someone who knows the cost of silence. Weaving cultural truths with the reality of hope and despair, Coleman\u2019s latest book is a testimony that unmasks psychological struggles, family discord, and the quest for wholeness. As a scholar and minister, Coleman has crafted a book that creates a safe space for people of faith to reflect on their journey toward truth, balance, and self acceptance.\u201d\u2014Thema Bryant-Davis, Past President, Society for the Psychology of Women, and Co-Editor, Womanist and Mujerista Psychologies: Voices of Fire, Acts of Courage\n\nMonica A. Coleman, MDiv, PhD, teaches theology and African-American religions at Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, CA. At CST, she was recently promoted to the position of full professor--making her the first African-American woman full professor at CST. She is a philosophical theologian who works with a process metaphysic, and the black and womanist theological traditions. Her writings cover womanist theology, sexual abuse, and the African-American experience.\n\nDr. Coleman is an ordained elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and a sought-after speaker and preacher. In 2005, the African American Pulpit names Coleman one of the \"Top 20 to Watch--The New Generation of Leading Clergy: Preachers under 40.\" Dr. Coleman has been featured as an expert in religion and mental health on NPR, Beliefnet.com, PsychCentral.com, and Huffington Post Live.

What do you do when your father kills himself, or your mother is committed to a psych ward, or your daughter starts hearing voices telling her to harm herselfor when you yourself hear such voices? Addressing bipolar disorder, OCD, trichillomania, self-harm, PTSD, and other diagnoses, these stories depict the difficulties and sorrows--and sometimes, too, the unexpected and surprising rewards--of living with mental illness.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nJennifer Metsker lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan where she is the Writing Coordinator at the Stamps School of Art and Design. Her poetry, which often addresses issues related to mental illness, has appeared or is forthcoming in many journals including The Cincinnati Review, Cimarron Review, Gulf Coast, The Seattle Review, Whiskey Island, Rhino, Cream City Review, and Birdfeast. She has written art reviews for Arthopper and Carbon Culture and recently was awarded the Third Coast Audio Shortdoc Prize for an audio piece that she created with artist Stephanie Rowden. \n\nMadeline Strong Diehl has worked as a magazine journalist, editor, and grant writer for almost 30 years.

She began her musical journey with the guitar and flute, which she hopes to incorporate into some filthy tunes.  Currently she\u2019s in the works of producing a variety of genres that come from the rhythm of the heart and her desire to inspire. From her bouncy house drops to her love of percussive, funky beats, she aims to provide a brilliant booty shakin experience that makes you let it all loose on the dance floor.\n___________________________________________________\n\nLighting provided by ProLux Entertainment\n\nProLux Entertainment focuses on putting on the best quality show for every event!

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, its no wonder why they are headlining festivals and one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album \u201cTerra Incognita \u201c goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments, and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

It's a family story that doesn't shy away from the difficult moments, but also doesn't dissolve into sentimentality. It's a window into another culture, without being a dry sociology lesson. It's a globe-trotting journey that doesn't fall into \"look at these slides of my vacation\" territory.

Under the new label, he rereleased Sparks EP and released the Goddess EP. His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers.

For two months he danced, filmed, made music, did standup comedy, wrote and much more, untill he found out what he loved doing most: making music. He uploaded a couple of tracks on Youtube and Soundcloud, and Bakermat was born. Since then he stepped in a rollercoaster ride he could have never imagined. First official single \u2018Vandaag (One Day)\u2019 became a huge hit all over Europe hitting top 10 spots in almost every country. The early succes got rewarded with platinum records in France, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. The succes was largely attributed to the fact that he came with an entirely different and new sound, combining minimal and deep house with jazz and soul. It laid a foundation for the genres we now know as \u2018tropical house\u2019 or \u2018melodic house\u2019, in which he is still seen as the founder and pioneer. He keeps trying to bring new and refreshing music out, always trying to be as unique and renewing as possible. A huge succes was his record released in 2015 \u201cTeach Me\u201d where he mixedSoul, Gospel and Disco to a record that set a new standard in the \u2018melodic house\u2019 genre. \n\nBakermat also became well know because of his innovative performances and stage hostings. He did shows in Paris, London and other big cities with an entire band called \u2018The Bakermat Live Band\u2019. In Paris he even played in the legendary L\u2019Olympia with his band, a sold out show. He played at almost every big festival there is over the last 3 years like I Love Techno, Ultra Miami, Sensation White, Mainsquare, Montreux Jazz Festival, Tomorrowland, Mysteryland, South West Four and the list goes on and on. He is also the host of stages at the biggest festivals like the \u2018Bakermat & Friends\u2019 stage at Tomorrowland every year, or the \u201cBakermat\u2019s Gospel Church\u2019 at Kingsday Festival and a lot more. As one of the founders his goal is to bring new talent or fellow colleagues to the stage and that's exactly what he does when he's curating a stage. Artists like Klingande, Thomas Jack, The Avener, Robin Schulz and Oliver Heldens are often guests at one of his stages. Bakermat\u2019s new album \u2018Bon Voyage\u2019 is his first studio album and will be released in 2015, it contains a lot of new material and new styles/ production techniques, because according to Bakermat this was an opportunity for him to \u201c really be free of restrictions and make exactly what I want\u201d. With his album, remixes, releases and confirmed shows at the biggest festivals lined up, it seems 2016 will be a great year for Bakermat once again.\n\n\nWho is Sam Feldt?\n\nDeemed a \"Modern House superstar\" by Billboard, Sam Feldt broke onto the scene in 2013 with remixes including \"On Trees and Birds and Fire\" from I Am Oak. In 2015, he released a remake of \"Show Me Love\" from Robin S. which charted highly across the world. \n\nThe Dutch DJ, born August 1, 1993, is currently signed to Spinnin' Records and most recently released \"Summer On You\", a melodic and deep tropical track with Lucas & Steve featuring Wulf.\n\nwww.PrimeSocial.com\n===============================\nGET INVOLVED: Want to get involved with PSG?

After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-25T21:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/832214916910877/", "description": "Sunday, September 29 | 9pm | 18+ | $17 adv./ $20 day of\nSongbook: A Night Of Stories & Songs with:\nBlitzen Trapper and special guest Kacy & Clayton\n\nOver the course of 15 years and seven full-length albums, Blitzen Trapper has crafted one of the more compelling and varied catalogs in contemporary rock and roll.

King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is Sound of the Broken. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-11T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1217154154983075/", "description": "New music!", "name": "Liz Longley\u2014\"Weightless Tour\""}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-11T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/603317689846712/", "description": "Tue.

October 27 | 8pm | All Ages | $25 Cover\n\nann arbor's 107one Presents:\nBrett Dennen wsg: Lily & Madeleine\n\nAs common and simple as it is, \"por favor\" is such an evocative expression. From Spanish, it translates to \"please,\" a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. \"Por favor' was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,\" says Brett Dennen. \"We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.\"\n\n\"When you say please, you're asking something to come into your life,\" Dennen adds. \"It might mean that you're weak and need something to make you strong. But you're admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.\"\n\nThat notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen's intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.\n\n\"All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn't feeling confident about myself,\" he says. \"When I'm not feeling confident, I'm not a nice person to be around. I don't take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I'm in that place.\"\n\nA followup to 2013's Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It's the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it's by no means a sad affair, nor is it the \"rainyday record\" Dennen initially thought he was making.\n\nOften framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. \"And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let's go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,\" he sings over a chugging groove on \"Bonfire.\"\n\nOn \"Where We Left Off,\" the album's emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: \"Everyone knows I'm a happy man/ But I haven't been right.\"\n\n\"Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,\" Dennen admits. \"Is there something I'm scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren't in that zone.\"\n\n\"I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,\" he continues. \"I don't have to worry about whether they'll be on the radio or if they're different from my previous stuff.\"\n\nHoled up at Cobb's Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb's insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. \"We recorded it the way people made records in the '60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,\" he says. \"We didn't do anything more than five times. We didn't secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It's not sloppy, but it's in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.\"\n\nCobb adds, \"I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He's very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.\"\n\nMore than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. \"My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,\" he says.\n\nThat marked a detour from his most recent releases. With those he felt like he was exercising his craftsmanship - \"being a songwriter for the sake of being a songwriter,\" as he puts it. \"I really wanted this new album to come across as a whole piece,\" Dennen says. \"I consider it to be a batch of songs that all live together and complement each other.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the album title. Please.\n\n\"What was I asking for with this album\" Dennen says. \"I wanted to be a good person and feel good about myself again, but in a way that I knew it was OK to be sad. That's part of life, the ups and downs. But with these songs, I want to make people feel good about themselves and about life through the good and bad.\"\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/718", "name": "Brett Dennen w/ Lily and Madeleine 10/27/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-28T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/147078752335941/", "description": "There is no better storyteller than Chuck Brodsky.  Ranging from poignant to hilarious, his songs are about the little things in the lives of everyday people.  Chuck's soulful and compassionate voice brings his characters to life, and is the perfect instrument for infusing his lyrics with heartfelt humanity or biting wit. His spoken introductions to his songs can be as spellbinding as his colorful lyrics, which he brings to life with a well-travelled voice and a delivery that's natural and conversational.

Obviously he needed to go back to Pittsburgh to be with his family. He returned to California relatively quickly, ready to work, and then I was struck with serious food poisoning.\u201d\n\nAs soon as one band member in the duo was ready to work, it seemed the other had something come up. Even their engineer, Chris Cheney, had to leave in the middle of recording to go DJ for the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Deadlines were rapidly approaching and the record wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cIt was stressful, but it seemed to all work out,\u201d Tim Fogarty adds.\n\nAppropriately, the record is all about family and the connection between parent and child. Opening with \u201cPoint Breeze\u201d (an area in Pittsburgh in which Tim\u2019s dad used to hang out when young) and moving right into \u201cScott Township\u201d (an area of Pittsburgh where Fogarty did the same), the record is alive with sounds both futuristic and anachronistic.\n\nThe album is full of parental nods. \u201c\u2019Fast Forward\u2019 is a band name my dad would always suggest when I was starting new bands in high school. I thought it was stupid and would blow him off! Now I actually think it\u2019s cool. It really represents something that is old, but also forward looking and inventive.\u201d Dunn explains. \u201cPeter and Jack\u201d is a thank you to father and son team Peter Hook (of New Order and Joy Division) and Jack Bates who, after playing some shows with El Ten Eleven, suggested to Dunn that he employ one of the six string basses they were using.\n\n\u201cNot to exaggerate, but the effect those two had on El Ten Eleven is sort of incalculable. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the Bass VI if it weren\u2019t for them. And the direction of the band definitely changed because of it,\u201d Dunn says.\n\nThe record was written at their homes and practice studio in Atwater Village, and recorded with Cheney at Costa Mesa Recording Studio in Costa Mesa, CA. Dunn and Fogarty are the only musicians that appear on Fast Forward; everything you hear was done by the two of them using two basses, electronic drums, acoustic drums, and myriad looping pedals and effects.\n\nWhile most artists use looping technology improvisationally, Dunn and Fogarty see the loopers themselves as another instrument. Over a decade plus together they\u2019ve attained hard-won virtuosity with the devices, and can now concentrate on songwriting itself rather than logistics. \u201cNothing we do is improvised\u201d explains Dunn. \u201cWhen we first started playing shows we\u2019d sometimes run into troubles with the loops and have to stop and retry songs!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like our rig itself is an instrument we\u2019ve had to master,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ll loop Tim\u2019s electronic drums with one of my pedals while looping my own bassline, then switch to my six string bass midsong while he moves to playing acoustic drums, layering up the sonics and shaping the song as it all grows.\u201d By refusing to use anything pre-recorded live they\u2019ve pushed themselves into new territory, now able to deftly recreate their complex compositions nightly.", "name": "El Ten Eleven w/ Bayonne 11/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/962264457225114/", "description": "New music from a folk icon", "name": "Jonatha Brooke"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513216465641630/", "description": "http://www.donhenry.com/", "name": "Don Henry at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-18T21:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1752094781672292/", "description": "Fri.
