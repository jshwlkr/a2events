Each year, on a rotating basis, the Ann Arbor Art Center presents a media-focused exhibition as part of the series. We are pleased to present this year's exhibit which features innovative work in photography.\n\nContemporary photography in America is at an exciting and transitory moment. Since the advent of digital photography, the medium has continued to shapeshift into an increasingly inclusive art form. It has been estimated that around 1.4 billion photographs are taken every day, and even more \u201cphotographs\u201d can be created by using scanners or creating photographic elements in digital software.\nSome photographic artists continue to use photography in traditional ways: to capture and record the actual world. From the most news-worthy events to the smallest domestic moments, the strength of these images is reliant on the perceptiveness and timeliness of the photographers making them. Other photographic artists create complicated digital collages that bear many similarities to painting. By removing the necessity of photography to show the thing itself, these artists can create constructed scenes within a photograph that never existed in the physical world. To complicate the medium further, the last several decades have produced a resurgence of photographs created through historic processes like cyanotype and wet collodian. Defining what photography is and what a photograph looks like has never been more challenging.\n\nWhile the world is currently experiencing an overflow of photographic images, what makes a photograph successful has stayed relatively unchanged. ART NOW: PHOTOGRAPHY highlights photographic artists that are able to use the world as a raw material to communicate their own visions and experiences. While the processes may vary significantly, this exhibition highlights innovative artists working in photography whose practices shapes what Photography is in 2016.\n-----------\nThe 117 Gallery 2015/2016 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1716244898615592/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-01T18:30:00-04:00", "name": "Dig In: Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n", "description": "Sponsored by the University of Michigan Credit Union, Arts & Eats: Dig In with UMS is a $15 ticket package deal that includes a great seat at the performance, exclusive access to a pre-show dinner, and a fun activity to get you thinking about the performance in a whole new way.

In Know the Mother, author Desiree Cooper explores the complex archetype of the mother in all of her incarnations. In a collage of meditative stories, women\u2014both black and white\u2014find themselves wedged between their own yearnings and their roles as daughters, sisters, grandmothers, and wives.\n\nIn this heart-wrenching collection, Cooper reveals that gender and race are often unanticipated interlopers in family life. An anxious mother reflects on her prenatal fantasies of suicide while waiting for her daughter to come home late one night. A lawyer miscarries during a conference call and must proceed as though nothing has happened. On a rare night out with her husband, a new mother tries convincing herself that everything is still the same. A politician\u2019s wife\u2019s thoughts turn to slavery as she contemplates her own escape: \"Even Harriet Tubman had realized that freedom wasn\u2019t worth the price of abandoning her family, so she\u2019d come back home. She\u2019d risked it all for love.\" With her lyrical and carefully crafted prose, Cooper\u2019s stories provide truths without sermon and invite empathy without sentimentality.\n\nKnow the Mother explores the intersection of race and gender in vignettes that pull you in and then are gone in an instant. Readers of short fiction will appreciate this deeply felt collection.\n\nA 2015 Kresge Artist Fellow, Desiree Cooper is a former attorney, Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist and Detroit community activist whose fiction dives unflinchingly into the intersection of racism and sexism.

And now, with their second full-length album Drinking From A Salt Pond, Run River North are poised to push forward and create their own wake as a major voice in today\u2019s music landscape.\n\nSince the band\u2019s beginnings just over four years ago, their rise has been steadily spectacular, marked by appearances on national television, sold-out shows at historic venues, tours with rock and roll royalty and heaps of praise from fans and critics alike. As they blossomed, they embraced their initially folk-driven sound, which found its harmonic home alongside rootsy, foot stomping, sing-along-leading peers like Mumford & Sons, The Head and the Heart, and Of Monsters and Men. Powered by the acoustic-guitar-and-vocals songwriting of frontman Alex Hwang, their 2014 self-titled debut record, produced by Phil Ek (Fleet Foxes, Modest Mouse, Band of Horses), was released with their lineup rounded out by the strings duo of Daniel Chae and Jennifer Rim, Joe Chun on bass, Sally Kang on keys, and John Chong on drums.\n\nAs time and tours passed, the six lives spent in close-quarters began to grind the gears a little differently; their whole dynamic began to change. \u201cWhen we became a band, we mostly played Alex\u2019s songs in band form,\u201d says Chae. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve all put our musical input into it, so the music has changed a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were tired of me on acoustic guitar and everybody singing harmonies,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe were hitting a ceiling, and it wasn\u2019t fun. We had always agreed this band was six-ways, for better or worse. So at the end of last year, after being in the van constantly, we said, \u2018no more touring, let\u2019s write new songs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to grow up pretty fast as a band,\u201d says Chong. \u201cSo this past year, there were times when different perspectives and priorities have butted heads.\u201d\n\nDuring the writing of Drinking From A Salt Pond, the band admits to flaring tempers and tense operations as they worked to redefine their sound, goals and relationships. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of hating each other, almost kicking people out of the band,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe\u2019re being honest and that openness is one of the main thrusts for the album. Embracing the bitter with the sweet, not trying to hide the crappy parts\u2026the crappy parts helped make the good.\u201d Being open about its faults, the band recognizes how the turmoil has helped Run River North create something beautiful.\n\n\u201cThe record we just made, it\u2019s all the difficult stuff we went through so there\u2019s a darker tone to the music. It works,\u201d says Chae.\n\nOne of the first steps in leaving behind their folk roots was to work with new collaborators. Instead of the reverb-heavy, northwest sound of Ek, they recorded in Los Angeles with Lars Stalfors (Cold War Kids, HEALTH, Deap Vally, Matt and Kim) at the production helm. Stalfors opened their eyes to the upbeat energy and electric tone of indie bands like The Walkmen. Throughout Salt Pond the indie rock influence can be heard, with the band nodding inspiration to everyone from Cage the Elephant and Kings of Leon to The National, Death Cab for Cutie, and Cold War Kids, whose studio in San Pedro, CA the band borrowed to make the album. Also, in a move encouraged by their record label, Nettwerk, Hwang and Chae were sent to Nashville for a week in April 2015 to work on a few new tracks with two different co-writers, Lincoln Parish (formerly of Cage the Elephant) and the Kings of Leon collaborator Nick Brown.\n\n\u201cIt was weird but at the same time it was really encouraging,\u201d says Hwang of the co-writing. \u201cIt was like bringing our demos to a blind date.\u201d\n\nThe first song from the Nashville sessions was \u201cRun Or Hide,\u201d co-written with Parish, and from first listen it\u2019s clear that Run River North are exploring bombastic new territory. Hwang, Chae, and Parish came up with an organic way of working that was based on jamming and vibing together, and once the song\u2019s melody was nailed down, the rest came easily. It was immediately hard-hitting than any previous song from the band, with a discernible strut serving as a sonic contrast. When the demo was sent home to LA, the rest of the band was shocked.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone else was really scared,\u201d says Hwang, \u201c\u2018this is not your voice, this is not who we are.\u2019 I was confident it was a really good song and that we were gonna keep it. There\u2019s nothing more aggressive on the record, and that groove on the verses is bigger than the band. The band can\u2019t contain the song.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved it!\u201d says Chong emphatically. \u201cAlex has a very wide range of emotion when he sings\u2014soft, whispery things; really bombastic; rough\u2014this song showcases all of that. I got really excited. When we recorded it, it really showcases more groove. Joe, our bass player, is solid, and the way the melody is created in the verses really adds to that. There\u2019s a really cool contrast happening, but the choruses hit hard.\u201d\n\nThe other song written in Tennessee was the Nick Brown co-penned \u201cCan\u2019t Come Down,\u201d a track with pop qualities that the band does not shy away from recognizing. For that they leaned on Brown heavily, who served almost as a mentor to Hwang and Chae during the sessions, teaching them about pop hooks, authenticity, and Southern tradition. Deciding to go all in on a pop song, the trio rallied behind Brown\u2019s catchy melodies and licks, and what they ended up with is a happy medium that \u201cstill sounds as Run River North as possible,\u201d according to Chong, while simultaneously reaching for the rafters.\n\n\u201cWe really gelled with Nick Brown,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe had the same idea: \u2018We have enough songs that exemplify us, so let\u2019s try our hand at writing a pop hook.\u2019 With that mentality we came up with \u2018Can\u2019t Come Down.\u2019 Nick wrote the hook, Daniel and Nick wrote the music, and a heavy collaboration on lyrics from everyone. It\u2019s the first song I ever sang the word \u2018baby\u2019 in.\u201d\n\nWith those songs firmly planting the band\u2019s flag in new ground, it is Hwang\u2019s \u201c29\u201d that may be the best indicator of the band Run River North are becoming. A piano and drum fueled anthem examining the ups and downs of transition, it finds the singer posing multiple existential questions at once. \u201cEveryone\u2019s always talking about how if you will something, it\u2019s gonna happen. But, sometimes it doesn\u2019t!\u201d says Hwang. \u201cThat was a realization I wanted to play with: \u2018Your words are cold like the wind\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s kind of like saying, \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think,\u2019 but it\u2019s also a reflection about my words. What I do can be just as insignificant as anyone else. So what are you gonna do about it? You\u2019re 29. \u2018I know it\u2019s home, I know it hurts/I know I\u2019ll end up at the bottom/What if I leave?\u2019 What if we go on this tour and we don\u2019t end up anywhere? The brutal question is, who cares, and why does it matter? Not answering that in the song really helps. The music is still upbeat, it still has the \u2018oh\u2019s\u2019 going on, it\u2019s an anthemic thing. I\u2019m still energetic, I\u2019m not some old dude at 29.\u201d\n\n\u201c29\u201d was written on electric guitar, a tool Hwang has been using more frequently since the end of the debut album\u2019s touring cycle. Originally intended for a more somber feel, at the suggestion of their producer Stalfors, the tempo rose to meet Hwang\u2019s intonations. \u201cIt became this song with so much energy,\u201d says Chong, \u201cit\u2019s probably the fastest song we\u2019ve ever done as a band. It\u2019s new territory for us; it\u2019s very fun. It\u2019s a good transition, with lulled verses and really upbeat instrumentals and choruses. This is a good appetizer for our old fans, as this is who we\u2019ve become.\u201d\n\nEmbracing their natural growth and learning to ride the waves of their personal and musical evolutions with open hearts and nimble hands, Run River North have created a sophomore album that will propel them to the forefront of today\u2019s landscape. Although at times the rushing water of their rise will pool into depths tough to swallow, they have learned to lean on each other and to trust themselves along the way in order to make something lasting and truly beautiful.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, we always said we wanted to play on the biggest stages possible,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cThat\u2019s still the same. But it isn\u2019t some self-indulgent dream of becoming rock stars; we still want to support our families with this, we still have the parents that sacrificed for us and we want to honor them. For us as a band, at times it\u2019s felt like we\u2019ve been drinking from a salt pond\u2014and yet, we still created something pretty fresh that we like and are proud of.\u201d\n\nWSG: The Lighthouse and the Whaler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/634", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/629378653882823/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-06T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Women's Hebrew Poetry on American Shores", "description": "Literati is pleased to present a roundtable discussion, in conjunction with the Jean & Samuel Frankel Center for Judaic Studies, to mark the publication of Women's Hebrew Poetry on American Shores: Poems by Anne Kleiman and Annabelle Farmelant.\n\nAlthough Anne (Chana) Kleiman\u2014who died in 2011 at the age of 101\u2014was the first American-born Jewish woman to publish poems in Hebrew, and Annabelle (Chana) Farmelant\u2014who is still living and occasionally publishing\u2014wrote a substantial body of Hebrew verse from the 1940s to the 1960s, their work is virtually unknown today, even to those familiar with Hebrew literature in America.

From 1983 to 1992 he was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, where he reported from Dallas, Houston, Pittsburgh and, during the late 1980s, covered the busy mergers and acquisitions beat in New York. He has written for Vanity Fair since 1992.\nIn 1990 Bryan and John Helyar co-authored Barbarians, the story of the fight for control of RJR Nabisco. The book, which spent 39 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has been hailed as one of the most influential business narratives of all time.

Seeley Professor of English at Allegheny College. He is the author of the poetry collections After Greece and Goat Funeral. He is also co-translator of The Lions\u2019 Gate: Selected Poems of Titos Patrikios, and the author of Honey, Olives, Octopus: Adventures at the Greek Table. Of Eternity & Oranges, Adam Zagajewski says: \u201cThis is a beautiful collection of poems: half-cryptic, half-open; half based on ancient myths, half on actual life. There\u2019s almost always Greece as the backdrop, olives and the sea but also a human drama. Christopher Bakken proves that what\u2019s ancient is also modern and vice versa. We live between times; only poetry can make it palpable.\u201d\n\nDavid Blair is the author of two previous poetry collections. He teaches at the New England Institute of Art. Another book, Arsonville, is forthcoming. Of his most recent work, Friends with Dogs, Tom Sleigh says: \u201cWhat gives weight and density to David Blair\u2019s remarkable poems is their almost Hardyish sense of regret and loss. So many of his poems are little dramas of what wasn\u2019t said when it should have been said, or of the way celebratory instincts get undermined by the pressures of day-to-day life. I admire the quick shifts in voicing, the way a whole social world becomes revealed in some small characteristic gesture, and how alert Blair is to other people. Very few poets ever achieve this kind of fellow feeling and write about it with such tact and intelligent sympathy.\u201d\n\nCody Walker is the author of Shuffle and Breakdown and the co-editor of Alive at the Center: Contemporary Poems from the Pacific Northwest. His poems have appeared in The Yale Review, Parnassus, Slate, Poetry Northwest, The Hecht Prize Anthology, and the 2007 and 2015 editions of The Best American Poetry; his essays have appeared online in The New Yorker and The Kenyon Review. He lives with his family in Ann Arbor, where he teaches English at the University of Michigan. Of his latest, Mary Jo Salter says: \u201cIn Cody Walker\u2019s The Self-Styled No-Child, the poet-father sings to his new baby (read \u2018Cradle Song\u2019 or \u2018Small Suite\u2019 for perfect little servings of delight), but his childlike playfulness has an internal source, too. The light verses in Walker\u2019s new collection often have dark edges to them (see \u2018The Garden\u2019 or \u2018We Hated Our Lives\u2019), and his social and political satires are unflinching. Still, this word-wizard with a genius for rhyme reminds us of how irrepressibly joy remains.\u201d", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/792881080812626/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-08T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Aventura March Madness", "description": "JOIN THE MADNESS!\nFor the first time ever Aventura will be showing all of the happenings for March Madness.\n\nTipping off with Selection Sunday we invite you to make your own Aventura March Madness Bracket.

We hadn\u2019t really thought a whole lot about the session in advance\u2014on tour, your default response to things is \u201clet\u2019s just show up and play\u201d\u2014and we were kind of under the gun time-wise when we got to the club. So we decided to just do it quick and dirty, old-school style. Like the open mic nights I used to play: unamplified guitar and vocals, friends with their axes playing along, arrangements arrived at on the fly and infinitely flexible. Four songs later we felt really inspired\u2014me and Matt played a song or two without anybody else around because we\u2019d gotten down to the basement before the others, the total song choice was strictly \u201cwhat do you figure we should play now?\u201d, the mood was relaxed and free\u2026we loved it. Later that night, we decided to strip down the drum kit to essentials and play a choke-the-motor set echoing and elaborating on what we\u2019d done downstairs: a sort of small-ensemble feel, lower in volume but actually higher in intensity. Like what we do in concentrate. It was one of our two favorite performances of the year, the other being the second night at the Fillmore. It felt like acres of new terrain opening up atop an ancient foundation. As soon as it was over, we all wanted to do it again. So in 2016 we\u2019re taking that set on the road. Not that exact set, obviously; the particulars will vary from night to night. But smaller rooms, audible frequencies, up close and personal: this is the general plan. Making eye contact with people in the back row, being able to go off-mic when I want to and still be heard. Total visibility. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this tour. I love the big album release shows as much as anybody, but that City Winery feel of just playing together with bare essentials in close quarters\u2026there\u2019s nothing like it, and when the whole room locks onto the signal, it\u2019s really special.\nWith: William Tyler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/581", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/554988117991170/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-09T15:00:00-04:00", "name": "Meet Local Author Melissa Grunow for a Discussion & Signing of Her Memoir 'Realizing River City'", "description": "Melissa Grunow is the author of Realizing River City: A Memoir (Tumbleweed Books, 2016).

April 9 | 8pm | 18+ | $10 adv./ $12 day of\n\nFlint Eastwood with: Marcus Alan Ward, Jacob Sigman & The Timbre of Cedar\n\nFlint Eastwood is the evolution of the creative side of Detroit-based multi-talented artist Jax Anderson. Flint Eastwood is what happens when friends and family gather in the forgotten spaces of an embattled city and are left to create with no rules, no boundaries, and nothing holding them back. Jax's endless creativity is a byproduct of growing up in a talented family.\n\nHer father was one of ten kids, each of whom played guitar and sang. Her oldest brother, Sam, played in punk bands, and Jax spent her teenage years learning the value of passion and acceptance at DIY shows. As she got older, her other brother (and Flint Eastwood collaborator and producer) Seth started playing in bands throughout the Detroit garage rock scene. Their dad worked as a curb address painter to pay the bills once the housing crash made his job as a mortgage broker invalid. During this time, Jax and her brothers went door to door, passing out flyers advertising her father's services, through some of the toughest residential neighborhoods in Detroit. These struggles helped form the vision that drives Flint Eastwood: to give everyone listening (whether live or on record) a momentary escape from the problems we all have.\n\nBetween helping around the house, Jax spent her days in her family's Detroit-area home, without cable and internet, teaching herself to play her father's 12-string Taylor guitar that he left for them in the living room. It was also during this time that her mother's love for Motown music began to influence Jax's knack for the theatrics and power of the Detroit sound, as Mom played records from The Temptations, the Jackson Five, and Earth Wind & Fire.\n\nOnce old enough to break out on her own, Jax briefly moved to a small German tourist town in rural Georgia, where the only station in town played solely pop and country. There, she fell in love with the hooks and harmonies that define American pop music. Later, she moved with Seth to Los Angeles, to mainly focus on writing for licensing opportunities and playing small clubs and house parties around town. While in LA, Jax developed a love for film, hopping on tour with bands every chance she could get as a self-taught videographer. Her experiences on the West Coast still influence Jax's push to make her musical endeavors into well-rounded multimedia presentations (mixing music with theatrical lighting, video projection, and costumes).\n\nUpon returning home to Detroit at the very beginning of the much-maligned city's recent resurgence, Jax's explosive and endearing personality on stage became the driving force behind Flint Eastwood. But through it all, it was the songs that were always the focus.\n\nOn their now sold-out debut EP Late Nights In Bolo Ties (2013), Jax and her friends mixed elements of pulsing electronic tracks with blistering bluesy guitar licks, all with a spaghetti-western backdrop, inspired by Sunday night movie sessions with Jax and her father.\n\nOn the forthcoming EP, Small Victories (to be released October 23), Jax has returned to her Detroit roots, mixing a taste of the theatricality of Motown music with her more recently found love for pop music. The result is six songs full of hooks. The type of tracks that you turn up a little too loud, close your eyes, and forget where you are for four minutes. In a live setting, the songs are taken to another level entirely, mixing a CHVRCHES-like depth with a twenty | one | pilots-style flair for the dramatic. This approach has led the band to rapidly gain an ever-growing fanbase. Their last two hometown headline plays have sold out (400+ tickets per show), and the band has toured heavily through the Midwest, mixing festival looks like Electric Forest, MoPop Festival, and Midpoint Music Festival with club appearances alongside acts such as Foxy Shazam, Mayer Hawthorne, Betty Who, X Ambassadors, and Andrew WK.\n\nSmall Victories was crafted and polished in Detroit\u2019s second oldest church, now repurposed as Assemble Sound, a hub of Detroit creativity that fosters artists through collaboration. In this crumbling but inspiring location, the new record was created as a coping mechanism to help Jax deal with the loss of her mother, who was her biggest fan and inspiration. As the listener makes their way through the EP, they experience Jax making her way through her mother's illness and passing, railing against it, dealing with the aftermath associated with such a loss, eventually accepting it, and using it as a driving force to continue to create.\n\nJax broke the EP down in one simple thought:\n\n\"Small Victories comes from the idea that doing anything creative in life takes a lot of persistence, struggle, and hustle. It's easy to expect that the spoils will come easily and be immediately fruitful. But if you focus on the little things, the \"small victories\", you realize that it's those things that are the most rewarding. That's what keeps me going.\"\n\nThe lead single is the EP's first track, \"Find What You're Looking For\", which is Jax's interpretation of her mother's final words to her:\n\n\"Don't let this break you\".", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1217913291571431/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-11T18:30:00-04:00", "name": "TheRide\u2019s ServiceFest", "description": "Get ready for the largest expansion of bus service since 1979!\n\nOrganizations are welcome to send front-line staff to learn how to assist clients with bus service information.\n\nThe May, 2016 service expansion will be the biggest in TheRide's history...creating more ways to connect with jobs, school, appointments, shopping and family and friends. \n\n\"Get Ready!\" for:\n*More routes to serve more places\n*More frequent service\n*More direct routes in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti\n*New route names and numbers\n*New service to Scio Township\n*New service in Pittsfield Township\n\nVisit http://TheRideYourWay.org/ for more information on the improvements coming on May 1st!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/194586454240654/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-11T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Poetry at Literati: Sarah Messer & Suzanne Wise", "description": "Literati is pleased to welcome Sarah Messer and Suzanne Wise as part of our celebration of National Poetry Month.\n\nSarah Messer has received grants and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mellon Foundation, the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, the Michigan Council for the Arts and others.

He wrote his first raps at the age of six and hasn't looked back since. Born in Illinois but moved to Arizona in high school, Futuristic's flow seems to be just as hot as his surroundings. His album \"The Rise\" released on May 12th 2015 debuted at #2 on itunes and #9 on Hip-Hop Billboard charts. He has been touring virtually non-stop over the last 2 years headlining his own tours and supporting bigger acts such as Somo & Machine Gun Kelly. His fast witty lyrics mixed with substance and relatable subject matter has gained him a die hard fan base called WTFGang which stands for \"We're The Future\". As an independent artist Futuristic takes pride in his creativity and versatility using his words to inspire his fans and let them know that anything is truly possible but also gives them music to BANG with the top down in the summer. Moving forward he expects to be exactly what he named his lead single from his album.... \"The Greatest\". Futuristic recently was featured on A Great Big World single \"Hold Each Other\" which has led him to National television performances on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, VH1 Streamy Awards, Performing for the Vice President Joe Biden & CEO of Apple Time Cook, for the HRC National Dinner in Washington D.C.\n\nGood music arguably comes from a place that is insightful, meaningful and modern.This is where the living weirdo known as Devvon Terrell lives and sleeps.

From shooting and editing videos to engineering, mixing and mastering all of his music. This jack of all trades mentality has earned him placements with And One Live, C2C Dj Khaled's Halftime Report, a number one Mixtape on Datpiff.com and countless other mediums. Devvon Terrell recently released his first album titled \"Weird Sexy Cool\" and earned a the spot of top 16 albums on the itunes RNB charts.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/769930223136488/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-19T13:10:00-04:00", "name": "Commute by Bus?

April 21 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nI don\u2019t know how to write a bio for an album. I\u2019ve never written one. I\u2019m a comedian. My job is to talk onstage for long enough that the trapped, drunken audience has to buy more chicken wings from the club. I am not qualified to write about music. And yet here I am, writing a bio for the new The Thermals record, We Disappear. Thank god it\u2019s a great fucking record.\n\nThe first time I heard The Thermals was on broken headphones while riding the A Train to Rockaway, Brooklyn, flying mere feet over a frozen Jamaica Bay on a too-bright January morning. I had just fallen in love with a wonderful, terrible woman who was thousands of miles away. I was very fragile, I had no boundaries, and I was the strongest I\u2019d ever been. And that\u2019s how this album feels. There\u2019s a new vulnerability here, but The Thermals\u2019 sound is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nThe Thermals are best at making songs you put on mixtapes named \u2018Drunken Sing-alongs When You\u2019re Sad.\u2019 They specialize in late-night, secret conversations about feeling simultaneously romantic and resentful over being raised Catholic. They\u2019re the soundtrack to breaking glass, and an ode to the beauty of brokenness.\n\nThey say that the mark of intelligence is the ability to hold two disparate and conflicting truths in the mind at the same time: I am a good person; I am not a good person. We Disappear lives in this delicate, in-between place: at once hard and noisy, while also soft and personal. And seeming contradictions abound on this album. We Disappear is an all-too-real, dark, and intensely personal album \u2013 in the past most of singer Hutch Harris\u2019 lyrics have been mostly fictitious tales \u2013 about how we try to outrun demise, whether personal or physical. It is an emotional document of how two people can tear each other apart, while simultaneously making you wanna get up and jump around the room.\n\nThe deeply dark, yet oddly catchy \u201cHeart Went Cold\u201d plays on the double metaphor of loss of love/life and features the sad realization \u201cI pushed you away\u201d, but is immediately followed by the super poppy \u201coh-oh oh\u201d. The classic fucking rock anthem \u201cHey You\u201d is a paranoid fantasy about running from the Grim Reaper as he calls after you, about \u201cbeing terrified of death,\u201d says Harris, but \u201ca celebration of that feeling as opposed to feeling sad about it.\u201d A surprisingly uplifting eulogy of the death of a relationship, \u201cThinking Of You\u201d is explained by Harris as \u201cone of the most straight-forward love songs we\u2019ve ever written, a point-blank post-break up song. It\u2019s a song that says exactly what it means. It and a lot of the record are about regret, i.e. still loving someone after a break-up and hanging on to these feelings.\u201d\n\nWe Disappear is also about separation in terms of technology, how it can isolate us and impact our relationships, and how humans have embraced it to the point where we\u2019ve already assimilated into it. \u201cThe Great Dying\u201d and \u201cInto the Code\u201d examine how we\u2019re so afraid we\u2019re going to be forgotten, or overlooked, that we upload everything about our lives onto the Internet.\n\nHarris explains, \u201cTechnology, love and death are the three obsessions of the record. Our privacy used to be so important to us and now everything has changed \u2013 we freely offer once private information about relationships and reveal everything about our day-to-day lives. We\u2019re trying to preserve our life digitally so when we\u2019re gone people won\u2019t forget us. We\u2019re using technology to become immortal. You can even set up Facebook and Twitter accounts to continue updating after you die! We Disappear is about how humans fight the inevitable.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure you want to know that the record will come out March 25th, 2016 on Saddle Creek, that it features the longest running Thermals line-up of Hutch Harris, Kathy Foster, and Westin Glass, and that it was recorded in Portland, OR at Kung Fu Bakery (The Shins, Tegan and Sara) and in Seattle, WA at The Hall of Justice (Nirvana, Mudhoney), and produced by Chris Walla (formerly of Death Cab For Cutie). But what really matters is that this record GETS IT. It walks that fine line between truth and lies, between death and life, between depression and joy \u2013 all the while recognizing that one cannot exist without the other. And it brings us with it. That\u2019s the reason to listen to this record: Because it\u2019s a fucking great album, by an amazing band.

The saxophonist was embraced by the jazz mainstream on the release of 1994\u2019s Moodswing, and he\u2019s been both a critical and commercial favorite ever since. The Bad Plus, by contrast, have courted controversy since the release of their 2003 major label debut, These Are the Vistas. But when Joshua Redman joined the idiosyncratic trio as a special guest a few years back, a brilliant collaboration was born. Redman\u2019s melodic prowess blends seamlessly with the \u201cavant-garde populism\u201d of The Bad Plus, pushing the boundaries of jazz beyond all imagination. Metroland describes this new all-star quartet best: \u201cIt\u2019s as though Redman is the long-lost fourth member of the group, just waiting to be snapped snugly into place.\u201d \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/the-bad-plus-joshua-redman", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1589849627952742/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-23T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Saul Conrad (Boston) w/ Ben Willis, Nick Zomparelli, Travis Jarosz", "description": "Far House presents an evening of neoclassical and avant-folk, featuring touring artist:\n\nSaul Conrad (Boston, Massachusetts)\nhttps://soundcloud.com/teamlove/sets/saul-conrad-requiem\n\nSaul Conrad\u2019s Requiem is a musical setting of the 12th century poem Dies Irae.

Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Backin the Ring. Chris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet,Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, TheLumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records. Chris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases.In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist. Her latest album, Backin the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimedHow I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons. \u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms.For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards. \n\nWSG: Anna Vogelzang\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/595", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1318721681600135/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-29T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Aventura March Madness", "description": "JOIN THE MADNESS!\nFor the first time ever Aventura will be showing all of the happenings for March Madness.\n\nTipping off with Selection Sunday we invite you to make your own Aventura March Madness Bracket.

One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time\u2014from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as The Travelling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains\u2014this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet. Sometimes terrifying, sometimes tender, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it.\n\nEmily St. John Mandel is the author of four novels, most recently Station Eleven, which was a finalist for a National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award, and won the 2015 Arthur C.

After being put on at the tender age of 17 by his cousin Ice Cube, Del released two records on Elektra, I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991) and No Need For Alarm (1993). Despite record sales in the hundreds of thousands, he recorded a third album, Future Development, which was never commercially released. Del parted with Elektra and started work on the Hieroglyphics..family album, 3rd Eye Vision (Hiero Imperium, 1998). Hiero went on the road and toured incessantly in support of the album for much of 1998. Del also spent a good portion of his time drawing, practicing Japanese, and playing mass amounts of video games. Finally ready to unleash a new record on the world, Del comes with BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. Seventeen tracks of pure Del. He says of his work on this album: ..\"I've had complete control\".

I wish that I had the same freedom that someone like Bjork has when she puts out an album..Apart from collaborations with PrincePaul, El-P (Company Flow), and help from a few of his Hiero cohorts (A-plus, Casual, Domino) Del handled the majority of production on this album.

The band consists of Jeanne Mackey, Tom Voiles, Linda Teaman, and Laz Slomovits. The name Harmony Bones comes from an acupuncture point that harmonizes imbalances and promotes clear thinking, seeing, and hearing.\nJeanne, Tom, Linda and Laz have joined forces to explore a wide range of traditional, contemporary and original folk songs. Rich vocal harmonies and an array of instruments -- guitar, mandolin, flute, pennywhistle, fiddle, banjo, percussion, sitar -- combine to make Harmony Bones.\nSinger/songwriter Jeanne Mackey offers a blend of emotional intensity, wry humor, and global consciousness. In addition to original tunes, her repertoire ranges from Dar Williams to Patsy Cline, from Pete Seeger to Irving Berlin. A seasoned guitarist, she draws on a variety of styles -- folk, classic swing, funky blues, and more -- with the occasional sprinkle of mandolin, accordion, or banjo. Mackey rocked the 1970s East Coast topical music circuit as a young musician advocating feminist values and social justice.  In 2010, Mackey created \"Drop The Knife: A Memoir-in-Song,\" an evening of original songs and stories exploring the meaning of homeland, curses, death, and magic.\nLinda Teaman and Tom Voiles do much of their singing and playing with Nutshell, an Ann Arbor-based Celtic roots band. Nutshell plays for contra-dances and performs at festivals across North America.\nLinda is a singer who brings depth of understanding, warmth and sensitivity to the music. In 2005, her graduation recital for a degree in k-12 choral music had her singing in five languages, encompassing musical forms such as Irish sean nos singing and Italian and German arias by composers Purcell, Mozart and Brahms. She leads the Rudolf Steiner Community Singers, a small choir that sings uncommon Christmas and seasonal songs of celebration.  She hopes you'll forgive her classical background and that she is redeemed by her love of folk music.  In addition to vocals, she adds light percussion to the mix.\nTom consumes a well-rounded musical diet that ranges from Celtic to Indian to rock and roll. He enjoys mixing different styles while maintaining a respect for the traditions from which they spring. Tom has studied North Indian Classical music, Moroccan folk drumming and western classical flute. He has worked with performance artists, dancers, mimes and poets, including Hosain Mosavat, Gerry the Fool, Matthew Smith, ML Liebler and the Magic Poetry Band.\nLaz Slomovits is one of the twin brothers in Ann Arbor\u2019s nationally-known children\u2019s music duo, Gemini. A fine singer and multi-instrumentalist, Laz is starting his 4nd year playing music. His songs are featured in songbooks used by music teachers throughout the country, and Gemini's recordings have won numerous awards. In addition, Laz has had a notable solo career. In his solo work, Laz is best known for his powerful musical settings of the poetry of ancient Sufi mystics Rumi and Hafiz, as well as that of contemporary American poets.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1637106023218709/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-13T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "An Atomic Whirl (JAPAN) w/ Sojii, Red Robe & Super Thing", "description": "Far House brings you an evening of high energy rock & roll, with a special international touring guest!\n\n\nAn Atomic Whirl (Japan)\nhttp://anatomicwhirl.com/\n\nAn Atomic Whirl mixes chaotic noise, sudden soft melodies and mathy arrangements.

Now, he issues the sharpest entry of his vision, the majestic The Blackberry Train engineered by Steve Albini (Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been an evolution,\u201d James says. \u201cThis set of songs definitely has a harder edge, but it\u2019s a continuation of the last album. The main thing for me is to not conform or compromise.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 panoramic artistry is inspired by such diverse musicians as Kurt Cobain, The Smiths, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, The Cure, The Beatles, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, and Hank Williams. His fingerprint aesthetic has earned him plaudits from Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Daily News. He\u2019s earned a strong following the old fashioned way, through tirelessly touring the US, Europe and the UK, and playing bigger and bigger shows with each go around.\n\nThe Blackberry Train is an epiphanic co-mingling of aesthetics. James sought out the distinct audio stylings of Steve Albini to conjure a grungier sensibility. He welcomed the engineer\u2019s gifts for capturing music with a raw clarity, and Steve Albini\u2019s reputation for not impinging on an artist\u2019s vision. The results make for an eclectic album with fastidiously crafted songs documented in the studio with glorious purity.\n\n\u201cI like the music to have elements of the avant garde, psychedelic, and be just a little against the grain,\u201d James reveals. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about having as much emotion as possible for me, musically and lyrically. It\u2019s all about the music being cathartic, heartfelt and true.\u201d\n\nThe Blackberry Train manages to be both diverse and cohesive. The album opens invigoratingly with the jangling rocker, \u201cToo Hard\u201d and closes with the stately and aptly named folk song \u201cPeace and Stillness.\u201d Between these bookends, highlights include the rough-edged and urgently melodic \u201cUnicorn,\u201d the anthemic \u201cPeyote Coyote,\u201d and the soulful ballad \u201cPrayer.\u201d One very personal song is the winsome and reflective \u201cWaterfall\u201d which was inspired by memories of his mother.\n\nThis summer and fall James will embark on extensive tour dates in the U.S. Thinking ahead, James says: \u201cI just want to keep on going, keep working, and improving as a songwriter. I\u2019d love to feel that I realized my full potential both as a person, and as a songwriter. That feels like a great, fulfilling goal to shoot for. Making a lot of music, and striving for more depth artistically\u2013those are my goals.\u201d", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/573249992825775/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-22T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "HONEYHONEY", "description": "Rescheduled from March 16.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1671101093151272/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-23T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "The Steve Nardella Blues Band", "description": "A walking encyclopedia of American blues and roots music", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1238691669478608/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-28T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Boy & Bear", "description": "International new folk sensations from Australia", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/662938483846794/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-29T18:00:00-04:00", "name": "Legal Issues for Artists", "description": "Our June Artists' Meet & Greet topic is Legal Issues for Artists.

Village, she sang her song, \"Beautiful People\" and inspired the first panorama of candles and cigarette lighters ever raised at a concert event. That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-21T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 1", "description": "Two nights with Steppin' in It's fast-rising lead vocalist", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1668844700041158/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-22T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Joshua Davis\u2014Night 2", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/215744518775574/"}]
