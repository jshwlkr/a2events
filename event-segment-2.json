In an era defined by mass incarceration, endless war, economic crisis, catastrophic environmental destruction, and a political system offering more of the same, radical social transformation has never been more urgent. Demand the Impossible! urges us to imagine a world beyond what this rotten system would have us believe is possible. In critiquing the world around us, insurgent educator and activist Bill Ayers uncovers cracks in the system, raising our sights for radical change, and envisioning strategies for building a movement to create a more humane, balanced, and peaceful world.\n\n\"For Bill Ayers, it is the freedom of our collective imagination that links the contemporary world\u2014ensconced as it is in pervasive militarism, racist violence, and environmental devastation\u2014to the flourishing of our planet. This is a manifesto that should be read by everyone who wants to believe that \u201canother world is possible.\u201d\u2014Angela Y. Davis, author of Abolition Democracy and Freedom is a Constant Struggle\n\n\"With huge numbers of us recognizing the need for transformative change, this ambitious and exuberant book perfectly matches its historical moment. Ayers fearlessly confronts the intersecting crises of our age\u2014endless war, surging inequality, unchecked white supremacy and perilous planetary warming\u2014while mapping emancipatory new possibilities. From the first page, his courage is contagious.\"\u2014Naomi Klein, author of This Changes Everything and The Shock Doctrine\n\n\"Demand the Impossible is more than a book, more than a manifesto. It is a torch. Bill Ayers\u2019 vision for a humane future is incendiary\u2014fire that incinerates old logics and illuminates new paths. If we do not end the violence of militarism, materialism, caging, dispossession, debt, want, ignorance, and global warming, our very survival is impossible. Read aloud.\"\u2014Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams\n\nBill Ayers is a social justice activist, teacher, Distinguished Professor of Education (retired) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of two memoirs, Fugitive Days and Public Enemy.\n\nEvent date: \nTuesday, January 10, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \n124 E.

Known for their viral remixes of \u201cTrap Queen\u201d, \u201cI Miss You\u201d and \u201cCool\u201d, the two have, in unprecedented time, mastered a wide range of genres from deep, melodic house to harder progressive cuts. With their Spotify and SoundCloud views now exceeding 35 million and with nineteen #1\u2019s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America. \n\nKicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Blink 182, Tori Kelly and Alesso to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct \u201cSoul House\u201d style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release. After receiving the \u201cAward of Independent Excellence\u201d from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey\u2019s hit \u201cBorn To Die\u201d scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014.\n\nFollowing multiple performances at San Francisco\u2019s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York\u2019s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Denmark, Mexico and Canada, showing off their potential in the international arena.\n\nWith support now coming from the likes of Tiesto, The Chainsmokers, Krewella and many more, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2016, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/TwoFriendsMusic\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/two-friends\nTalk: https://twitter.com/twofriendsmusic\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/twofriendsmusic\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/twofriendsmusic/\n\nDoors open at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services are available. contact: VIP@necto.com", "name": "Two Friends at Necto", "date": "2017-01-12T21:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1299649313440032/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Now playing through January 8!

Emerging patterns, thoughts and ideas begin to show themselves in a way that was impossible to see by only looking at one. Things are always in conversation with each other. Their meanings are derived through interactions with other elements and those meanings change as context changes. Artists often employ comparison, context and groupings to create meaning in their work. While there are many different approaches that can be taken, the outcome is the same; to create a larger entity that arises through the interactions among smaller or simpler entities.\n\nIn Emergent Effect, the artists use these methods to create meaning and find meaning in the spaces between all of their work as well. All the artists have their practices located in Ypsi Alloy Studios and in that shared space they also share ideas.

Live Guitar and Vocals. Based in Michigan.\n\n+++ Tek - Mazter ++++\nTek-Mazter is in the game for the love of the music and the process of creating it for other people's ears to enjoy. He never sticks to performing or creating just one genre, his mixes and tracks consist of anything from the heaviest Riddim Dubstep to Chill Trap. In his short career he has performed alongside DJ Starscream (Slipknot's DJ), has been local support for Ghastly, Truth, Eptic, YOOKiE, AB The Thief and Toadface, opened for Timeflies & Walk Off The Earth, DJ'd for D12's Bizarre and has played some legendary venues such as The Detroit Masonic Temple, St. Andrews Hall, Necto Nightclub, Elektricity Nightclub and The Works Nightclub.\n\n+++ KNGHT +++\nMy name is Brendan Knight \nI perform and produce Experimental Bass music\nMichigan is my home and I love what I do!\n\n+++ KAZRK +++\nThis Bass Duo has residencies at some of the hottest dance bars and nightclubs throughout the state of Michigan, and have had massive opening sets for headliners such as Nghtmre, Slander, Funtcase, Liquid Stranger, Skism, Trampa, Ghastly, and many more. Now before you think they're just a one-genere style Duo, think again. KAZRK has a broad spectrum for music ranging from all ends of electronic dance music, hip-hop, and rap genres. Farthest from the common mixing styles, no two sets are ever the same. With mixing abilities take you on a journey throughout each genre telling a story unlike any other. As each set progresses, you'll find yourself at the other end of the musical spectrum.\n\n+++ DJ Lachjaw +++\nDJ Lachjaw - A local Detroit DJ that brings the heat to the stage is going on his 5th year mixing music starting out back in 2012. He has built his reputation by standing out and perfecting his craft. If you've seen him perform you know it's far from a mellow disappointment so be ready for a dish of a full force brutal double dropping bass chopping experience. Over the years he has supported many artists opening the stage for Funtcase, Sewer Sessions, Subtronics, Boogie T and many more. \n\n+++  Brightside +++\nFor the 25 year old Queens native producer, Brightside, it's not just about the music, it's about the movement. His vision is to produce auditory art that brings people together and creates a sense of community. Brightside has a predominantly mid-tempo sound, drawing inspiration from all ends of the spectrum. In a conscious effort to reach all audiences, Brightside samples a widely eclectic library of music from all around the world, creating psychedelic sounds with Middle Eastern, Asian, Classic Rock, Hip-Hop and even Reggae flare.\n\n\n+++  Blaqout +++\nWhether you've seen him live, or heard of the barrage of releases that have been coming out, Lance \"Blaqout\" Dean has a firm grip on what he's doing and is not looking to stop anytime soon. This young producer heiling from St. Louis, Missouri has proven what others have told him to be impossible, or improbable.

In 1967 Stella began a thirty\u2013year creative collaboration with master printer Ken Tyler and his Los Angeles workshop. Stella and Tyler inspired and challenged each other to move in exciting new artistic directions. The Museum was recently gifted three exceptional prints that developed out of this historic partnership. Based on Stella\u2019s paintings from the Notched-V series, they reflect the artist\u2019s signature geometric style of the 1960s, during which he eschewed illusionistic space, choosing instead large\u2013scale, shaped canvases that tightly frame the composition. The prints are both optical and tactile: The ink rises from the paper and the slightly rough lines reveal the artist\u2019s hand.\n\nThis work was recently gifted to UMMA by Marsha Vinson and Marvin Rotman and will be on display till April 23, 2017.", "name": "In Focus: Frank Stella", "date": "2017-01-17T11:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/712053682285362/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Biscuits for Your Outside Man: A Fundraiser Dinner for the Music Makers Relief Foundation\n\nThough the Blues has had an enormous impact on American music, many of the form\u2019s most influential artists have struggled behind the scenes.

Huron Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.\n\nAn Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared in 2010 to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of proposed improvements to the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport. The proposed improvements focus on shifting and extending Runway 6/24, the primary runway, to address the needs of the existing critical aircraft that use the airport. Alternatives were developed to provide options for extending the existing runway by 795 feet, from 3,505 feet to 4,300 feet, while extending the existing parallel taxiway to the same length.  \n\nThe original 2010 Environmental Assessment has been revised and updated, however the proposed improvements have not changed between the original 2010 EA and the recently revised EA.\n\nThe revised EA is available for public review starting today until February 10, 2017 at the following locations:\nAnn Arbor Municipal Airport\n801 Airport Drive\nAnn Arbor, MI 48108\n\nAnn Arbor Public Library 343 S.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake.\n\nGrowing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now.\n\nConcurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention.\n\nEarly Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year.\n\nAbout Golf Clap:  DJs; producers; club headliners; after-party enthusiasts: Golf Clap are Hugh Cleal and Bryan Jones, a Detroit duo with an unmatched passion for house music and a seemingly endless supply of studio and club-focused creativity. And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nWith roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up.\n\nReleases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, Spring Awakening, North Coast, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact.\n\nWhether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San, Skream, or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them.\n\nAs with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans.\n\n2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/djworthysf/videos\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/worthy\nTalk: https://twitter.com/w_o_r_t_h_y\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/WorthySF\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/itsworthy/\n\nDoors at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services available contact: VIP@necto.com \u2022 734-994-5436 \u2022 necto.com", "name": "Worthy with Golf Clap at Necto", "date": "2017-01-26T21:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/981986061934932/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe", "date": "2017-01-27T15:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/606106682905446/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Generation Gap  \nGroup 2: Either Who\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "name": "Pointless Improv with Generation Gap and Either Who", "date": "2017-01-27T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/294126047648964/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Laugh as our League and guests tackle long form improv with their hilarious skills.

At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nWSG: Scott Hirsch\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "name": "Hiss Golden Messenger 1/28/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2017-01-28T21:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1300798096618445/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Cash & Carry\nGroup 2: Improv!

Please let the repairer know how comfortable you are at each stage of diagnosis and repair.\n\nItems that are often easier to repair: lamps, types of toys, broken wires, things that need epoxy/wood glue\n\nItems that are often very difficult to repair: consumer electronics such as CD/Cassette boom boxes, TVs, radios, CD players, VCRs, and DVD players", "name": "Fix-It Friday (third Friday of every month)", "date": "2017-02-17T16:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/396224057386783/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Art Off The Wall 2016 is the Ann Arbor Art Center's BIGGEST Holiday Exhibition and Shopping Event ever!

The five participants in Beyond Sacred share the common experience of coming of age in a post-9/11 New York City, at a time of increasing Islamophobia. Participants come from a range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds and include young men and women who reflect a range of Muslim identities, including those who converted to Islam, those who were raised Muslim but have since left the faith, those who identify as \u201csecular\u201d or \u201cculturally\u201d Muslim, and those who are observant on a daily basis.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/beyond-sacred-voices-of-muslim-identity/", "name": "Beyond Sacred: Voices of Muslim Identity: Ping Chong + Company", "date": "2017-02-18T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1756234927931657/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Sat.

The same group that pro-duced the scuzzy squalor of their debut \u201cSunken,\u201d had legions of fans screaming along to their anthemic sophomore effort, \u201cWild Onion,\u201d now swings and serenades with \u201cDown In Heaven\u201d (out on Grand Jury on May 13th).\n\nCo-produced by the band and longtime collaborator R. Andrew Humphrey, and mixed by new confidant John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile, Sonic Youth), the rec-ord is by turns raw, polished and wise beyond its years. The diverse new songs beg the listener to sway slowly, bang their head wildly and question what they were do-ing wasting emotional time on anything less. It is a marked, and some may say ma-ture, development for a band that doesn\u2019t know how to play it safe.

In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.  www.tomchapin.com", "name": "Tom Chapin at Green Wood Coffee House", "date": "2017-03-03T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1093572227425292/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "\u201cThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis is so far from the usual big-band clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d (Dallas)\n\nSince 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble.

Using technology and a technique, described by Dr. Didg, as live phrase sampling or looping, I am able to entertain myself for two sets. Nothing is prerecorded and all sounds and beats are created live by layering loops on top of one another and then singing or soloing over top if all if it.\n\nSee what I mean? Only being there can explain it.  The thousands of hours on YouTube cannot describe the feeling and vibe of one of my solo shows\u2026..at least the feeling that I get.

March 17 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nElectric 6\nEternal life can seem like an eternity. Ask any vampire. The continuous march of sun ups, sun downs, transformations of form, seductions, cape fittings & exsanguinations. Eventually it all just becomes an endless, tired routine. It all seems so exciting & so sexy to those of us who operate knowing we have limited time. But ask any vampire about the downside of eternal life, & you won't be surprised to hear tales of binge eating garlic bread just to feel the hurt, or of the occasional dangling of a wooden stake just over the center of the rib cage. Electric Six knows all about eternal life. Electric Six has been around forever & it can never die. That's lovely, but it's also very tiring. Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres is the new release by Electric Six on Metropolis Records. One listen & you will immediately understand that the sexiest vampires are urban vampires. Where E6 has dabbled in dance, hip-hop & R&B in the past, Fresh Blood is the whole enchilada. It's thirteen songs designed to make the listener interested in smooth & nasty fuckin', the way they do it in the city. From the Grandmaster Flash-inspired Number Of The Beast to the super smooth tour of the NYC outer boroughs Mood Is Improving, the listener finds himself immediately deposited into an urban drop zone with hustlas & dickblockas coming from behind every corner. The radio-ready pop hits I'll Be In Touch & Dance With Dark Forces are the tracks that get the listener off the street & into the club. & it would not be an Electric Six album without an epic closer, that being the beautiful & haunting Spacewalkin', the ballad that assures the listener that the vampire has now fed & will live a thousand more years, albeit in outer space. Electric Six changes more frequently than change itself, but ultimately this just means they're never gonna put out the same album twice. Fresh Blood for Tired Vampires is poppy & smooth, nasty & raw...& oh so life affirming, especially if you are undead", "name": "Electric 6 - 3/17/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2017-03-17T21:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1798409430410398/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "FREE\n\nJoin dancers from Kidd Pivot  for an exploration of the company\u2019s movement style.\n\nNo dance training or experience necessary, and all levels, ages 13 and up, are welcome.
