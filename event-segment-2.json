From the 1970s through the 1990s, changes in Detroit were almost all for the worse, as the built fabric of the city was erased through neglect and abandonment. But over the last decade Detroit has seen the beginnings of a positive transformation, and the photography in Detroit Is No Dry Bones provides unique documentation of the revival and its urbanistic possibilities. Beyond the fate of the city\u2019s buildings themselves, Vergara\u2019s camera has consistently sought to capture the lives of Detroit\u2019s people. Not only has he shown the impact of depopulation, disinvestment, and abandonment during the worst years of the urban crisis, but he has also shown Detroiters\u2019 resilience. The photographs in this book are organized in part around the way people have re-used and re-purposed structures from the past. Vergara is unique in his documentation of local churches that have re-occupied old bank buildings and other impressive structures from the past and turned them into something unexpectedly powerful architecturally as well as spiritually.\n\n\u201cVergara is especially alert to changes in the urban landscape . . . perhaps more people will take a second, closer look at the wealth of native folk art we have all over town. And Vergara deserves thanks for recording them and offering a serious critical appraisal.\u201d\n\u2014Detroit Metro Times\nCamilo Jos\u00e9 Vergara was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow in 2002 and received a Berlin Prize Fellowship in 2010. In 2013, he became the first photographer to be awarded the National Humanities Medal. He is author of numerous books, including Silent Cities: The Evolution of the American Cemetery; The New American Ghetto; and Harlem: The Unmaking of a Ghetto.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1169444286484219/", "name": "Camilo Jose Vergara: Detroit Is No Dry Bones"}, {"date": "2017-01-26T08:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

Huron Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.\n\nAn Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared in 2010 to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of proposed improvements to the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport. The proposed improvements focus on shifting and extending Runway 6/24, the primary runway, to address the needs of the existing critical aircraft that use the airport. Alternatives were developed to provide options for extending the existing runway by 795 feet, from 3,505 feet to 4,300 feet, while extending the existing parallel taxiway to the same length.  \n\nThe original 2010 Environmental Assessment has been revised and updated, however the proposed improvements have not changed between the original 2010 EA and the recently revised EA.\n\nThe revised EA is available for public review starting today until February 10, 2017 at the following locations:\nAnn Arbor Municipal Airport\n801 Airport Drive\nAnn Arbor, MI 48108\n\nAnn Arbor Public Library 343 S.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake.\n\nGrowing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now.\n\nConcurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention.\n\nEarly Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year.\n\nAbout Golf Clap:  DJs; producers; club headliners; after-party enthusiasts: Golf Clap are Hugh Cleal and Bryan Jones, a Detroit duo with an unmatched passion for house music and a seemingly endless supply of studio and club-focused creativity. And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nWith roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up.\n\nReleases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, Spring Awakening, North Coast, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact.\n\nWhether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San, Skream, or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them.\n\nAs with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans.\n\n2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/djworthysf/videos\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/worthy\nTalk: https://twitter.com/w_o_r_t_h_y\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/WorthySF\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/itsworthy/\n\nDoors at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services available contact: VIP@necto.com \u2022 734-994-5436 \u2022 necto.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/981986061934932/", "name": "Worthy with Golf Clap at Necto"}, {"date": "2017-01-27T17:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Join us every Tuesday for beer and veggies!

Without becoming didactic or pedantic about the spiritual metaphor hidden in the concept of the \"bird-while,\" Keith Taylor\u2019s collection evokes certain Eastern meditative poets who often wrote in an aphoristic style of the spirit or the mind mirroring specific aspects of the natural world.\n\nThe Bird-while is a collection of forty-nine poems that meditate on the nature\u2014both human and non-human\u2014that surrounds us daily. Taylor is in the company of naturalist poets such as Gary Snyder and Mary Oliver\u2014poets who often drew from an Emersonian sensibility to create art that awakens the mind to its corresponding truths in the natural world. The book ranges from the longer poem to the eight line, unrhymed stanza similar to that of the T'ang poet Han-Shan. And without section breaks to reinforce the passing of time, the collection creates greater fluidity of movement from one poem to the next, as if there is no beginning or end, only an eternal moment that is suspended on the page. Tom Pohrt\u2019s original illustrations are scattered throughout the text, adding a stunning visual element to the already vivid language. The book moves from the author\u2019s travel accounts to the destruction of the natural world, even species extinction, to more hopeful poems of survival and the return of wildness. The natural rhythm is at times marred by the disturbances of the twenty-first century that come blaring into these meditations, as when a National Guard jet rumbles over the treeline upsetting a hummingbird, and yet, even the hummingbird is able to regain its balance and continue as before. At its core, Taylor\u2019s collection is a reminder of Emerson\u2019s idea that natural facts are symbols of spiritual facts.\n\nKeith Taylor teaches at the University of Michigan. He has published many books over the years: collections of poetry, a collection of very short stories, co-edited volumes of essays and fiction, and a volume of poetry translated from Modern Greek.\n\nTom Pohrt is a self-taught artist who has illustrated numerous books including The New York Times bestseller Crow and Weasel by Barry Lopez. He recently illustrated Terrapin and Other Poems by Wendell Berry and Careless Rambles, a selection of poems by John Clare. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nEvent date: \nFriday, January 27, 2017 - 7:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1194461353983196/", "name": "Poetry at Literati: Keith Taylor"}, {"date": "2017-01-27T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Celebrating 15 years of the annual gala tradition - wine included!\n\nThis year Kerrytown Concert House is pulling out all the stops (and wine bottle corks!) for WWS XV!

Our previous troupes have performed around southeast Michigan, and former CIE members have been cast at Pointless Brewery & Theatre, Planet Ant Theatre, and Go Comedy! Improv Theater.\n\nAuditions will take place at the A2CT Studio (322 W. Ann St, Ann Arbor) on Saturday, January 28 from 6:00-9:00, and Sunday, January 29 from 3:00-6:00. Auditioners must be at least 18 years old, and need attend only one of the two audition days, but should plan to stay the entire time if possible. No pre-registration is required - please arrive a few minutes early to fill out an audition form.\n\nCallbacks for the long-form troupe only will take place Monday, January 30 from 7:00-10:00 at Brain Trainers (2900 S State St, Ann Arbor).\n\nNo preparation or previous experience is required for auditions, which will consist of a variety of short improv games and some basic two-person scene work. We are looking for actors with good energy, a willingness to take chances, and the ability to listen closely on stage and react honestly. Please wear comfortable clothes and be prepared to move. The only fee for Civic Improv is the standard membership fee for all A2CT actors - $25 per year.\n\nEach of our three coaches is looking to cast a troupe of 6 to 12 actors. The three troupes will be:\n\nShort-Form Troupe - coached by Shelly Smith\nThis troupe will focus on short-form games like those featured on Whose Line Is It Anyway or at ComedySportz. This is a great place for those brand new to improv to start out, as well as quick-witted quipsters and anyone who's a fan of fun.\n\nMid-Form Troupe - coached by Jen Delisi\nLearn to create longer scene-based stories in this troupe. Jen introduces improvisers to a variety of tools for bridging the gap between short-form games and long-form scene work. With a clap of their hands, your fellow improvisers will send your characters to unusual locations and hilarious new situations.\n\nLong-Form Troupe - coached by David Widmayer\nScene work is the core of long-form improv - improvisers will learn to walk onto a blank stage with nothing but a simple suggestion and create unique, complex characters and a whole world for them to inhabit. This troupe will be introduced to a variety of scenic forms, and ultimately choose and develop a signature format to bring to their performances.\n\nPlease email David Widmayer (djwidmayer@gmail.com) with any questions.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1328285543896539/", "name": "Civic Improv Auditions!"}, {"date": "2017-01-28T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Celebrating 15 years of the annual gala tradition - wine included!\n\nThis year Kerrytown Concert House is pulling out all the stops (and wine bottle corks!) for WWS XV!

At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nWSG: Scott Hirsch\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1300798096618445/", "name": "Hiss Golden Messenger 1/28/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2017-01-29T00:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "COLD-PRESSED JUICE CLEANSES ARE BACK!\n\n... and just in time for the New Year!

Buie, Assistant Professor/ Section Chair of Printmaking at the College for Creative Studies.\n\nART NOW: PRINTMAKING is the third annual exhibition in the Ann Arbor Art Center\u2019s Art Now Series.  Each year, on a rotating basis, the Ann Arbor Art Center presents a media-focused exhibition as part of the series. We are pleased to present this year's exhibit which features innovative work in printmaking.\n\n\u201cWe deal with printed images every day. Anything that is made in a reproducible format is a print.\u201d  - A Complete Guide to Materials & Processes by Beth Grabowski & Bill Fick\n\nThe field of printmaking is an ever-evolving medium that is deeply engaged in the act of social practice. Printmakers are artists who employ the rich history of printmaking as a basis for the works they create, and are also known to share their methods, facilitate workshops, and create environments where collaboration is welcomed. Although printmaking is considered to be a niche field of study, it is universally known through its traditional and historical processes such as Lithography, Intaglio, Relief, and Screen-printing. Printmaking has paved the way for technology and many digital advances, changing the landscape of the art world, politics and education. Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1936 essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d suggests that a series or an edition is equal to an \u201coriginal\u201d work, which holds an historical perception of uniqueness and authenticity.\n\nWhile some artists are heavily based in traditional modalities of printmaking, other artists will test the limits of what defines a \u201cprint\u201d and push beyond the conventional boundaries, thus allowing for hybrid processes to be employed and combined. The use of such advances include, digital photo-based imaging, sculpture, performance, video, installation, painting and drawing.\n\nThis exhibition will highlight artists that employ traditional printmaking processes, as well as artists who move across disciplines, using \u201cprint\u201d as their foundation, with an emphasis on investigative and exploratory ways of working with the printed image.\n\n-----------\n\nThe 117 Gallery 2016/2017 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC\n\nArt Now: Printmaking is sponsored by Underground Printing", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1857023781249128/", "name": "Art Now: Printmaking"}, {"date": "2017-02-03T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "When the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir landed in New York for its first North American tour in 1995 (including a stop in Ann Arbor for UMS\u2019s very first concert at St. Francis), they were known only as the performers on the best-selling CD of fellow-Estonian Arvo P\u00e4rt\u2019s austere Te Deum.\n\nThe concerts showed much more \u2014 a virtuosic ensemble that could dazzle in everything from Bach to folk songs.

Katie will be joined in conversation by Natalie Bakopoulos, author of The Green Shore.\n\nA young woman has agreed with her faithless husband: it\u2019s time for them to separate. For the moment it\u2019s a private matter, a secret between the two of them. As she begins her new life, she gets word that Christopher has gone missing in a remote region in the rugged south of Greece; she reluctantly agrees to go look for him, still keeping their split to herself. In her heart, she\u2019s not even sure if she wants to find him. As her search comes to a shocking breaking point, she discovers she understands less than she thought she did about her relationship and the man she used to love. \n\nA searing, suspenseful story of intimacy and infidelity, A Separation lays bare the gult that divides us from the inner lives of others. With exquisitely cool precision, Katie Kitamura propels us into the experience of a woman on edge, with a fiercely mesmerizing story to tell.\n\n\u201cA slow burn of a novel that gathers its great force and intensity through careful observation and a refusal to accept old, shopworn narratives of love and loss.\u201d \u2014Jenny Offill, author of Dept. of Speculation\n\n\u201cA novel so seamless, that follows its path with such consequence, that even minor deviations seem loaded with meaning. Wonderful.\u201d \u2014Karl Ove Knausgaard, author of My Struggle\n\n\u201cThe burnt landscape, the disappearance of a man, the brilliantly cold, precise, and yet threatening, churning tone of the narrator\u2014make A Separation an absolutely mesmerizing work of art.\u201d \u2014Rachel Kushner, author of The Flamethrowers\n\n\u201cProfound and gripping. I had that rare sense of feeling like I was in a creation specifically made out of words, that couldn\u2019t have been made out of any other substance. Kitamura combines the calm complexity of Joseph Conrad with the pacing and reveal of Patricia Highsmith. This novel is a wonder and a pleasure.\u201d \u2014Rivka Galchen, author of Atmospheric Disturbances and Little Labors\n\n\u201cA Separation opens up fissures of ambiguity in emotional experiences too often misunderstood as monolithic\u2014grief, desire, estrangement\u2014and plumbs these crevices for all their complexities. It has both urgency and afterglow: I read it quickly, but didn\u2019t stop thinking about it for a long time once I was done.\u201d \u2014Leslie Jamison, author of The Empathy Exams\n\nKatie Kitamura is a critic and novelist living in New York City.

Teenage Linda lives with her parents in the austere woods of northern Minnesota, where their nearly abandoned commune stands as a last vestige of a lost counter-culture world. Isolated at home and an outsider at school, Linda is drawn to the enigmatic, attractive Lily and new history teacher Mr. Grierson. When Mr. Grierson is faced with child pornography charges, his arrest deeply affects Linda as she wrestles with her own fledgling desires and craving to belong.\n\nAnd then the young Gardner family moves in across the lake and Linda finds herself welcomed into their home as a babysitter for their little boy, Paul. But with this new sense of belonging come expectations and secrets she doesn\u2019t understand. Over the course of a summer, Linda makes a set of choices that reverberate throughout her life. As she struggles to find a way out of the sequestered world into which she was born, Linda confronts the life-and-death consequences of the things people do\u2014and fail to do\u2014for the people they love.\n\nWinner of the McGinnis-Ritchie award for its first chapter, and A BEA Buzz Book and An ABA Indies Introduce Selection, Emily Fridlund\u2019s agonizing and gorgeously written History of Wolves introduces a new writer of enormous range and talent.\n\n\u201c\u2018Winter collapsed on us that year. It knelt down, exhausted, and stayed.\u2019 So much is accomplished here, not least a kind of trust that this writer will make everything count, including the kind of data that is usually left for dead in a story.

Participants come from a range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds and include young men and women who reflect a range of Muslim identities, including those who converted to Islam, those who were raised Muslim but have since left the faith, those who identify as \u201csecular\u201d or \u201cculturally\u201d Muslim, and those who are observant on a daily basis.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/beyond-sacred-voices-of-muslim-identity/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1756234927931657/", "name": "Beyond Sacred: Voices of Muslim Identity: Ping Chong + Company"}, {"date": "2017-02-18T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Bun Boiz \nGroup 2: Worklight\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1848964212052082/", "name": "Pointless Improv with Bun Boiz and Worklight"}, {"date": "2017-02-18T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Sat.

Having careened across America and beyond, sharing their staggering energy, the band made their third album the best way they know how: by themselves. The same group that pro-duced the scuzzy squalor of their debut \u201cSunken,\u201d had legions of fans screaming along to their anthemic sophomore effort, \u201cWild Onion,\u201d now swings and serenades with \u201cDown In Heaven\u201d (out on Grand Jury on May 13th).\n\nCo-produced by the band and longtime collaborator R. Andrew Humphrey, and mixed by new confidant John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile, Sonic Youth), the rec-ord is by turns raw, polished and wise beyond its years. The diverse new songs beg the listener to sway slowly, bang their head wildly and question what they were do-ing wasting emotional time on anything less. It is a marked, and some may say ma-ture, development for a band that doesn\u2019t know how to play it safe. They aren\u2019t here to tell you what youth is like or what being a little older now means, though; they want to join you in a conversation about why we hurt, love and tug at each other.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/133920627102754/", "name": "Twin Peaks 2/18/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2017-02-18T22:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Worklight \nGroup 2: Bun Boiz \nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/251458191949429/", "name": "Pointless Improv with Worklight and Bun Boiz"}, {"date": "2017-02-19T12:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Back by popular demand, it's Vault of Midnight's franken-toy extravaganza!

In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.  www.tomchapin.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1093572227425292/", "name": "Tom Chapin at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2017-03-04T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "\u201cThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis is so far from the usual big-band clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d (Dallas)\n\nSince 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble.

March 17 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nElectric 6\nwsg: Residual Kid\n\nEternal life can seem like an eternity. Ask any vampire. The continuous march of sun ups, sun downs, transformations of form, seductions, cape fittings & exsanguinations. Eventually it all just becomes an endless, tired routine. It all seems so exciting & so sexy to those of us who operate knowing we have limited time. But ask any vampire about the downside of eternal life, & you won't be surprised to hear tales of binge eating garlic bread just to feel the hurt, or of the occasional dangling of a wooden stake just over the center of the rib cage. Electric Six knows all about eternal life. Electric Six has been around forever & it can never die. That's lovely, but it's also very tiring. Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres is the new release by Electric Six on Metropolis Records. One listen & you will immediately understand that the sexiest vampires are urban vampires. Where E6 has dabbled in dance, hip-hop & R&B in the past, Fresh Blood is the whole enchilada. It's thirteen songs designed to make the listener interested in smooth & nasty fuckin', the way they do it in the city. From the Grandmaster Flash-inspired Number Of The Beast to the super smooth tour of the NYC outer boroughs Mood Is Improving, the listener finds himself immediately deposited into an urban drop zone with hustlas & dickblockas coming from behind every corner. The radio-ready pop hits I'll Be In Touch & Dance With Dark Forces are the tracks that get the listener off the street & into the club. & it would not be an Electric Six album without an epic closer, that being the beautiful & haunting Spacewalkin', the ballad that assures the listener that the vampire has now fed & will live a thousand more years, albeit in outer space. Electric Six changes more frequently than change itself, but ultimately this just means they're never gonna put out the same album twice. Fresh Blood for Tired Vampires is poppy & smooth, nasty & raw...& oh so life affirming, especially if you are undead", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1798409430410398/", "name": "Electric 6 - 3/17/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2017-03-18T14:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "FREE\n\nJoin dancers from Kidd Pivot  for an exploration of the company\u2019s movement style.\n\nNo dance training or experience necessary, and all levels, ages 13 and up, are welcome.
