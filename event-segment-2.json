In this class we\u2019ll cover the basics of programming the Raspberry Pi in Python, connecting simple switches, LEDs, and sensors, and creating web pages that provide remote sensing and control. We\u2019ll even do our programming right on the Raspberry Pi itself with a full-featured Linux operating system, graphical user interface, editors, and web browsers.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with the Arduino, the Raspberry Pi is a great platform for those projects that need lots more memory, more speed, video output, internet, USB, or other features. Unlike the Arduino, there is no low-cost or reduced size or power option. You may also enjoy the ease and power that Python offers as a programming language, and the many possibilities of the underlying Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nThis is a beginner course, so no electronics or programming experience is necessary. (It may move slow for experienced programmers!)\r\n\r\nWe suggest ages 12 and up, but advanced younger people will probably do fine.\r\n\r\nWe supply a model 2 Raspberry Pi and all parts for use in the class. You\u2019ll take home a comprehensive set of class notes.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the Raspberry Pi at www.raspberrypi.org/\r\nPlease arrive 10 minutes early if visiting Maker Works for the first time. $90\r\nCall Maker Works at 734-222-4911 or visit http://www.supersaas.com/schedule/makerworks/CheckOut?day=14&month=11&year=2016&view=day to sign up.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1669121740084145/"}, {"date": "2016-11-21T18:00:00-05:00", "name": "Art Off The Wall Holiday Exhibition & Shopping Event", "description": "Art Off The Wall 2016 is the Ann Arbor Art Center's BIGGEST Holiday Exhibition and Shopping Event ever!

This will be a no-drop group ride and is a great chance for novice MTBer's to get exposure to single track riding and be a fun way to burn off that Thanksgiving feast and get a jump start on getting fit for 2017.  The ride will be about 14 miles long covering ~5.5 miles at Hewens Creek and ~6.5 miles at Rolling Hills along with a few miles of dirt road connecting the two parks.  For those who haven't ridden or rarely ride at either trail, Hewens Creek is a flat, winding ride through meadows and new growth forest which is great for beginning riders.  The RHP trail on the other hand twists and turns through 4+ miles of forest and rolling hills that provide a great opportunity to improve your bike handling skills and 2.5+ miles of open meadows.  The 1.2-mile West Meadows loop on the west side of RHP includes beautiful open meadows and some fun pump-track like riding on the Munger Mounds.   \n\nMeet at the Rolling Hills Lodge at 9:45 AM and then we will head out by 10-10:15 AM.  After the ride, we will have some pizza and refreshments at the lodge at about 12:30 PM.  Please register in advance at Event Brite to attend so a good estimate of riders can be made for the pizza and beverages.  Rain date will be Saturday 11/26 at 10 AM.  Look for changes in schedule on the Rolling Hills or Hewens Creek forums on the MMBA website, the Poto Yahoo! Group Email list, the Poto MBA Facebook page or Poto MBA Twitter account.\n\nPlease park in the MTB trail head parking lot:  enter the park, go straight through the traffic circle and park in the first lot on your right next to a big pavilion ~1/4 mile west of the circle.  The Lodge will be about 200 yards away on your left.  \n\nThere will be a gate charge to enter RHP.  It is a Washtenaw County Park so if you already have WCP sticker you are good to go.  Otherwise, park entry will cost $5 for everyone as a discount for non-Washtenaw residents was arranged.\n\nLast but definitely not least, we have to thank DeWight and crew at Wheels in Motion for supporting the MTB community by sponsoring this event and paying for the food and refreshments since its inaugural event in 2009.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1197643866959330/"}, {"date": "2016-11-25T11:00:00-05:00", "name": "Black Friday Sale", "description": "ABC is offering a one day discount on some of our finest, funkiest brews, all of which are suitable for drinking now (think hostess gifts, toasting the New Year or simply enjoying on a cold winter night in front of the fireplace) or laying down to cellar (in your already established cellar or that collection you have been meaning to start)! \nAnnually on Black Friday we release a the newest vintage of our Wild Root Special Reserve, this year is our 2014 brew and we promise, you will not be disappointed! \n\nThe featured bottles:\n\nWild Root Special Reserve 2014 - A tart and complex old ale aged in oak for a year and bottle conditioned for an additional year. Autumnal aromas of crisp apple and earthy wet leaves mingle with sweet-tart sour cherry. Rich, vinous wet tobacco and juicy fruits on the palate are complemented by subtle chocolate and caramel notes and balanced by lactic acidity, tart green apple and dry tannins that persist through a long and slightly mineral finish.\n\nFramboise 2016 - Our take on this classic style is neither spontaneously fermented nor barrel aged, but the addition of lactic acid and raspberries to our crisp Blonde create a flavor that is refreshingly tart without being aggressively sour or acidic. A crisp and refreshing brew with tart raspberry, and subtle notes of zesty orange peel and spicy coriander.\n\nAnniversary Barleywine 2015 - Our 20th anniversary ale combines the best of all worlds \u2013 big, rich malts with plenty of nutty and caramel sweetness; the bitterness of a heavy-handed dose of resiny locally grown hops; and the warming alcohols you would expect in a high gravity brew. An American Barleywine brewed with predominantly Thomas Fawcett malts and Michigan-grown Chinook hops. We brewed this bad boy in honor of our 20th anniversary because a big celebration demanded a big beer! And since running a brewery is sometimes sweet and sometimes sour, we decided to pull off a portion of the beer to sour in our cellar.\n\nDivette 2013 - A tart and refreshing barrel-aged blonde ale spiced with orange peel and coriander. The combination of spices, oak aging, and bottle-conditioning creates a unique flavor experience that seems part beer, part wine, and part cider even though it is made with one hundred percent malted barley.\n\nBrune 2015 - Brune is a classic, refreshingly soured Flemish style brown ale in the Rodenbach tradition. A dark, copper-red, medium-bodied ale with subtle spiced sour cherry and woodsy notes. This beer has a pronounced tart sourness on the palate that follows through with complex, malty, and earthy vinous flavors.\n\nAll selections are only available exclusively at the Brewpub.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/531742880354118/"}, {"date": "2016-11-25T15:00:00-05:00", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe", "description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1144162335698642/"}, {"date": "2016-11-25T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Holiday Improv Show with Donny & Lisa and With Wieck", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nThe League will invite volunteers from the audience to share stories about their holidays \u2013 funny, awkward, sad, or wacky \u2013 and then they will perform scenes inspired by these tales.\n\nGroup 1: Donny & Lisa \nGroup 2: With Wieck\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/511083695755016/"}, {"date": "2016-11-25T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Earphorik // Stormy Chromer // 11.25.2016 Club Above, Ann Arbor", "description": "Earphorik and Stormy Chromer teaming up for an epic double-headlining show at the Club Above!\n\nDoors 9pm\nStormy Chromer - 9:30-11:00pm\nEarphorik - 11:30pm-end\n18+ // $6 at the door", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1220895527971258/"}, {"date": "2016-11-25T21:30:00-05:00", "name": "The Macpodz with On the Sun at the Blind Pig - Nov. 25", "description": "The Macpodz continue their exploration of sound and Dylan Charles brings his Brooklyn group for a visit to the midwest to perform psychedelic soul", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1291269264238314/"}, {"date": "2016-11-25T22:00:00-05:00", "name": "A Pointless Display of Improvised Feats \u2013 Thanksgiving Twist", "description": "Our League of Pointless Improvisers will invite audience members and performers to share their Thanksgiving tales, and will then create an improvised show based on these. \nNo two shows are the same! \nTickets are $10.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1850537738514983/"}, {"date": "2016-11-26T08:00:00-05:00", "name": "10% For Good for Community Action Network", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

Nenadic & M. Joanne Nesbit for an evening of discussion about Ann Arbor Icons and Legends.\n\nWhat is an iconic Ann Arbor restaurant? Ask anyone who has ever spent time there as a student, traveler, or townie, and they are likely to name several favorites in an instant. From debating the best place to celebrate or console on football Saturdays to deciding where to eat after the bars close, the choices have always sparked passionate conversation. In Ann Arbor, people are known to have strong feelings about the best places for pizza, coffee, beer, burgers, noodles, and burritos. Although many of the go-to hangouts are long gone, a surprising number still thrive. And there are always a few newcomers coming along to win the hearts of the next generation of diners, nibblers, and noshers. Some are fine restaurants and taverns, and others are lunch counters, diners, carry-outs, and drive-ins but in each and every case, they are unique and together make up a collection of iconic local eateries.\n\nGraced by the Huron River with an abundance of parks, Ann Arbor offers residents and visitors entertainment, sports, shopping, dining, and of course, the University of Michigan. Legendary Locals of Ann Arbor celebrates its citizens. Some of those who make up Ann Arbor are creative artists, inspiring educators, dedicated public servants, and determined business owners. With the exception of Lewis the cat, who reigned at Downtown Home and Garden, this book is filled with stories about people who have made and are making Ann Arbor one of the best places to live in the United States. Within its pages lie the stories of who chose maize and blue as the University of Michigan s colors; who was the first Ann Arborite to race in the Indy 500; and who sold Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino s, his first pizzeria. Inside are photographs and descriptions of the legendary people of the past and the present, as well as those who are on their way to becoming the legends of the future.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/660281374136185/"}, {"date": "2016-11-29T08:00:00-05:00", "name": "10% For Good for Community Action Network", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

Born and raised in Alabama, James Boggs came to Detroit during the Great Migration, becoming an automobile worker and a union activist. Grace Lee was a Chinese American scholar who studied Hegel, worked with Caribbean political theorist C. L. R. James, and moved to Detroit to work toward a new American revolution. As husband and wife, the couple was influential in the early stages of what would become the Black Power movement, laying the intellectual foundation for racial and urban struggles during one of the most active social movement periods in recent U.S. history. \n\nStephen Ward details both the personal and the political dimensions of the Boggses' lives, highlighting the vital contributions these two figures made to black activist thinking. At once a dual biography of two crucial figures and a vivid portrait of Detroit as a center of activism, Ward's book restores the Boggses, and the intellectual strain of black radicalism they shaped, to their rightful place in postwar American history.\n\nStephen Ward, Associate Professor at the University of Michigan Residential College, is a historian in the Social Theory and Practice program and is jointly appointed in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies. He was the founding coordinator of the Urban Studies minor and serves as the faculty director of the Semester in Detroit program. He teaches courses in African American history, urban and community studies, and Detroit history. He is the author of In Love and Struggle: The Revolutionary Lives of James and Grace Lee Boggs (2016) and the editor of Pages From a Black Radical's Notebook: A James Boggs Reader (2011).

Born in the Philippines, Cuna moved to Maryland, adapting to his new environment by engaging with music and skate culture. But it wasn\u2019t long before R&B entered the picture, first as an obsession and later, while Cuna was at university in New York, as a creative outlet. Growing up in the 2000s, it\u2019s no surprise that Cuna\u2019s heroes include R&B producer mavens like Pharrell and Timbaland, as well as French dance music behemoths Daft Punk, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s filtered those influences into the ingenious sonic aesthetic, a sound equally fitting both the festival stage and bedroom play, that makes Sweater Beats such an unavoidably intriguing project.\n\nSince bubbling up in the dance world with the premiere of his debut single \u201cMlln Dllr\u201d on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio1 show, Sweater Beats has constantly pushed the limits of his own sound. With support from the likes of Diplo, Omarion, and JoJo, plus tours with artists like Chance the Rapper, Flume and Chet Faker, the producer has clearly caught the eye some of a wide variety of tastemakers. Featured by the likes of Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Boiler Room and The FADER, Cuna has also received admiration from music journalists the world over, drawing almost universal praise from disparate outlets. With countless collaborations, mixes, and remixes, on top of a constant touring schedule, Cuna has garnered a reputation for his incessant work rate and willingness to push his sound into new and uncharted territory. And that\u2019s part of the reason why Cuna connects with his fan base on such a visceral level, eschewing traditional industry methods for his own unique, intimate manner of going about business.\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/768", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1759418600997980/"}, {"date": "2016-12-02T22:00:00-05:00", "name": "Crazy Holiday Feats", "description": "Our League of Pointless Improvisers will invite audience members and performers to share their holiday tales, and will then create an improvised show based on these. \nNo two shows are the same! \nTickets are $10.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1643997675892579/"}, {"date": "2016-12-03T08:00:00-05:00", "name": "10% For Good for Community Action Network", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

This event is part of a poetry series held on the second Thursday of most months at 7pm.\n\n(NOTE: There will not be an Open Mic event in January 2017. )\n\nSaleem Peeradina is one of the most important Indian poets writing in the English language. In Final Cut, his fifth collection, the poet\u2019s focus is turned towards the beauty that lies below the surface of the everyday; the extraordinary hiding in the ordinary.\n\nThese poems are hymns of praise \u2013 to birds, to objects, to fruits and to our own human bodies, intently recounting the character and history of each. In time, items as mundane as a sparrow, a stapler or an orange take on the appearance of wondrous gifts.\n\nThese meditations are joined by monologues, the remarkable yet unremarkable stories of characters encountered by the poet in India, Michigan and beyond.

Mitchell's credits include A Prairie Home Companion and repertory theatre in Texas and in England. He has played Harold Hill in The Music Man and Woody Guthrie in Woody Guthrie's American Song. Most recently, he wrote and produced Mr. Foster & Mr. Twain, in which Stephen Foster joins Mark Twain for an evening of story and song. A Chuck Mitchell's show combines his seasoned skills as an actor, singer and guitarist with a selection of delightful material. He sings cabaret songs by Brecht and Weil -- \"Mack the Knife\" and \"The Bilbao Song\" -- and whimsical songs by Flanders & Swann -- \"The Gnu\" and \"Have Some Madeira, M'dear\". He roves the room singing \"Freeborn Man\" by Ewan McColl, or \"Necessity\" from Finian's Rainbow. He weaves poetry by Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot into his shows.

While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1574155032886638/"}, {"date": "2016-12-15T08:00:00-05:00", "name": "10% For Good for Community Action Network", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

A musical identity which led her to play in the USA (including the festivals Coachella, Lightning In A Bottle, Shambhala...), Canada, India, Berlin, and more than 30 cities in France, alongside artists like Bonobo, Gramatik, Chet Faker, Tipper, TOKiMONSTA, Tipper, Big Gigantic, GRiZ...\n\nRunner-up of several remix contests (launched by artists like Mr. Bill, Asian Trash Boy, Crazy Daylight, Daenine...), CloZee was spotted by respected labels such as Gravitas Recordings, Glitch Hop Community, Adapted Records, Digital Whomp, Empathy Recordings, MOR Records, Waxhole Records\u2026 \n\nWebsite - http://www.clozeemusic.com/\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/clozee\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/CloZee \n\nPsymbionic\nCresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound.\n\nJohn Burcham has been moving bodies and turning heads as Psymbionic for several years in all corners of the USA, playing with acts such as Bassnectar, STS9, Big Gigantic, ill.Gates, Excision, EOTO, and Tipper. His passion and innovation in the music world are showcased through album releases on Muti Music and MalLabel, as well as in his role as label manager for the popular Electronic imprint Gravitas Recordings.\n\nIn a live show context, Psymbionic confronts mixes that are limited to the scope of the build and release, avoiding an industry epidemic of drop-monotony that overpowers the flow of music. Burcham seeks to prove that there are more powerful influences in moving a crowd than simple tension, providing an interwoven dynamic that relies on the strength of his blend, rather than the sole force or familiarity of the apex.\n\nPsymbionic's theory of music is a journey that doesn't visit the same place twice, building excitement for what's next not because you can anticipate it, but because you've never been there before.\n\nWebsite - http://www.psymbionicmusic.com/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/psymbionic\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/psymbionic", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1417695524925106/"}, {"date": "2016-12-16T16:00:00-05:00", "name": "Fix-It Friday (third Friday of every month)", "description": "Bring your well-worn items that could use a tune up, and we'll take a look at them! \n\nOr, make someone else's day by volunteering at Fix-It Friday and repairing their items.\n\nFix-It Friday:\nThink of this as the last chance before you get rid of something; Free, but no Guarantee.\n\nWe will:\n- try to diagnose what is wrong\n- tell you if we think we may be able to fix it today\n- tell you if you'll need a part, and where you might be able to get it\n- try to fix it to the best of our ability, but in the limited time we have\n\nHowever, we may not be able to fix it.

January 28 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nHiss Golden Messenger\nThe writing of the songs that became Heart Like a Levee started in a hotel room in Washington, DC , in January of 2015 during a powerful storm that darkened the East Coast. At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1300798096618445/"}, {"date": "2017-01-29T16:00:00-05:00", "name": "Inon Barnatan, Anthony McGill & Alisa Weilerstein", "description": "Inon Barnatan, piano\nAnthony McGill, clarinet\nAlisa Weilerstein, cello\n\nThis powerhouse trio brings together some familiar faces.\n\nInon Barnatan was the featured piano soloist with the New York Philharmonic last fall, Anthony McGill is the New York Philharmonic\u2019s principal clarinetist, and Alisa Weilersten has performed on both the Choral Union Series and the Chamber Arts Series in recent years.

Nothing is prerecorded and all sounds and beats are created live by layering loops on top of one another and then singing or soloing over top if all if it.\n\nSee what I mean? Only being there can explain it.  The thousands of hours on YouTube cannot describe the feeling and vibe of one of my solo shows\u2026..at least the feeling that I get.

McBurney transports us into the humid depths of the Amazon, its intense soundscape a new approach to site-specific theater.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/the-encounter/", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1802665646634100/"}, {"date": "2017-04-04T17:00:00-04:00", "name": "Ann Arbor Derby Dimes 2016 season", "description": "Save these dates to head over to beautiful Buhr Park (unless noted otherwise) and see fast paced, full contact roller derby action from your local league, Ann Arbor Derby Dimes!\n\nMay 14 - June 11 - July 9 - August 6\n\nBUY 2016 SEASON PASSES: http://bpt.me/2537986\n\nJuly 9\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Border City Brawlers: All-Stars\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Border City Brawlers: Canadian Clubbers\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/29dSJv0\nBUY JULY 9 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539693\n\nAugust 6\nArbor Bruising Co. vs Flint City Derby Girls\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs Killamazoo Derby Darlins: Kill Squad\nBUY AUGUST 6 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2539697\n\nFor more information, see our 2016 season schedule: http://a2derbydimes.org/2016-schedule\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\nPreviously this season:\n\nMay 14\nBrawlstars vs The Chicago Outfit: Syndicate\nYpsilanti Vigilantes vs East Lansing Roller Derby: Broadbarians\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/1reSK5y\nBUY MAY 14 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2537998\n\nJune 11\nBrawlstars vs North Star Roller Girls: Supernovas\nArbor Bruising Co. vs North Star Roller Girls: Northern Lights\nRSVP on FB: http://bit.ly/29dSikp\nBUY JUNE 11 TICKETS: http://bpt.me/2538000", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/192972824428594/"}, {"date": "2017-04-05T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Tift Merritt", "description": "New music from a great Americana songstress", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/205677959875058/"}, {"date": "2017-04-07T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Shawn Mullins", "description": "New music from a preeminent Atlanta songwriter", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/550917835118430/"}, {"date": "2017-04-11T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Shane Koyczan", "description": "\"Shane Koyczan is at the heart of a Category Five creative hurricane.\"\u2014Vancouver Sun", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/309991802717749/"}, {"date": "2017-04-12T00:00:00-04:00", "name": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining!", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Promo Gift Cards* with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Promotional Gift Card for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get $50 free in Promotional Gift Cards for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Holiday Combo Package \nFor only $75 get $50 in Gift Cards and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks. \n\nMSV Distinctive Recipes Cookbook\nOur MSV Distinctive Recipes cookbook lets you share in the experience of preparing uniquely styled entr\u00e9es and award-winning recipes.
