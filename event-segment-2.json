His investigations into form and materials have led him to continually explore the parameters of two\u2013 and three\u2013dimensional space. In 1967 Stella began a thirty\u2013year creative collaboration with master printer Ken Tyler and his Los Angeles workshop. Stella and Tyler inspired and challenged each other to move in exciting new artistic directions. The Museum was recently gifted three exceptional prints that developed out of this historic partnership. Based on Stella\u2019s paintings from the Notched-V series, they reflect the artist\u2019s signature geometric style of the 1960s, during which he eschewed illusionistic space, choosing instead large\u2013scale, shaped canvases that tightly frame the composition. The prints are both optical and tactile: The ink rises from the paper and the slightly rough lines reveal the artist\u2019s hand.\n\nThis work was recently gifted to UMMA by Marsha Vinson and Marvin Rotman and will be on display till April 23, 2017.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/712053682285362/", "date": "2017-01-17T11:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "African American Special Dinner: Biscuits for Your Outside Man", "description": "Biscuits for Your Outside Man: A Fundraiser Dinner for the Music Makers Relief Foundation\n\nThough the Blues has had an enormous impact on American music, many of the form\u2019s most influential artists have struggled behind the scenes.

Limited by age and abject poverty, many of these artists have almost given up hope when instead they should be celebrated and recorded into history.\n\nJust like the Music Makers have brought back musicways embedded in American roots, Zingerman\u2019s Roadhouse has strived to connect with foodways that are steeped in American culture.

Describing the emotional impact of the show, she says, \u201cThis play brings us into the character's lives.  We don't see what we expect from a Victorian stereotype.

From the 1970s through the 1990s, changes in Detroit were almost all for the worse, as the built fabric of the city was erased through neglect and abandonment. But over the last decade Detroit has seen the beginnings of a positive transformation, and the photography in Detroit Is No Dry Bones provides unique documentation of the revival and its urbanistic possibilities. Beyond the fate of the city\u2019s buildings themselves, Vergara\u2019s camera has consistently sought to capture the lives of Detroit\u2019s people. Not only has he shown the impact of depopulation, disinvestment, and abandonment during the worst years of the urban crisis, but he has also shown Detroiters\u2019 resilience. The photographs in this book are organized in part around the way people have re-used and re-purposed structures from the past. Vergara is unique in his documentation of local churches that have re-occupied old bank buildings and other impressive structures from the past and turned them into something unexpectedly powerful architecturally as well as spiritually.\n\n\u201cVergara is especially alert to changes in the urban landscape . . . perhaps more people will take a second, closer look at the wealth of native folk art we have all over town. And Vergara deserves thanks for recording them and offering a serious critical appraisal.\u201d\n\u2014Detroit Metro Times\nCamilo Jos\u00e9 Vergara was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow in 2002 and received a Berlin Prize Fellowship in 2010.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake.\n\nGrowing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now.\n\nConcurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention.\n\nEarly Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year.\n\nAbout Golf Clap:  DJs; producers; club headliners; after-party enthusiasts: Golf Clap are Hugh Cleal and Bryan Jones, a Detroit duo with an unmatched passion for house music and a seemingly endless supply of studio and club-focused creativity. And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nWith roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up.\n\nReleases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, Spring Awakening, North Coast, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact.\n\nWhether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San, Skream, or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them.\n\nAs with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans.\n\n2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/djworthysf/videos\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/worthy\nTalk: https://twitter.com/w_o_r_t_h_y\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/WorthySF\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/itsworthy/\n\nDoors at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services available contact: VIP@necto.com \u2022 734-994-5436 \u2022 necto.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/981986061934932/", "date": "2017-01-26T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe", "description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/606106682905446/", "date": "2017-01-27T15:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Laith Al-Saadi / 1/27 FRI / Blind Pig / Ann Arbor / 2 Shows", "description": "It's sad to hear the news that the Blind Pig is up for sale.

Without becoming didactic or pedantic about the spiritual metaphor hidden in the concept of the \"bird-while,\" Keith Taylor\u2019s collection evokes certain Eastern meditative poets who often wrote in an aphoristic style of the spirit or the mind mirroring specific aspects of the natural world.\n\nThe Bird-while is a collection of forty-nine poems that meditate on the nature\u2014both human and non-human\u2014that surrounds us daily. Taylor is in the company of naturalist poets such as Gary Snyder and Mary Oliver\u2014poets who often drew from an Emersonian sensibility to create art that awakens the mind to its corresponding truths in the natural world. The book ranges from the longer poem to the eight line, unrhymed stanza similar to that of the T'ang poet Han-Shan. And without section breaks to reinforce the passing of time, the collection creates greater fluidity of movement from one poem to the next, as if there is no beginning or end, only an eternal moment that is suspended on the page. Tom Pohrt\u2019s original illustrations are scattered throughout the text, adding a stunning visual element to the already vivid language. The book moves from the author\u2019s travel accounts to the destruction of the natural world, even species extinction, to more hopeful poems of survival and the return of wildness. The natural rhythm is at times marred by the disturbances of the twenty-first century that come blaring into these meditations, as when a National Guard jet rumbles over the treeline upsetting a hummingbird, and yet, even the hummingbird is able to regain its balance and continue as before. At its core, Taylor\u2019s collection is a reminder of Emerson\u2019s idea that natural facts are symbols of spiritual facts.\n\nKeith Taylor teaches at the University of Michigan. He has published many books over the years: collections of poetry, a collection of very short stories, co-edited volumes of essays and fiction, and a volume of poetry translated from Modern Greek.\n\nTom Pohrt is a self-taught artist who has illustrated numerous books including The New York Times bestseller Crow and Weasel by Barry Lopez. He recently illustrated Terrapin and Other Poems by Wendell Berry and Careless Rambles, a selection of poems by John Clare. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nEvent date: \nFriday, January 27, 2017 - 7:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1194461353983196/", "date": "2017-01-27T19:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Wine, Women, and Song XV", "description": "Celebrating 15 years of the annual gala tradition - wine included!\n\nThis year Kerrytown Concert House is pulling out all the stops (and wine bottle corks!) for WWS XV!

January 28 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nHiss Golden Messenger\nThe writing of the songs that became Heart Like a Levee started in a hotel room in Washington, DC , in January of 2015 during a powerful storm that darkened the East Coast. At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nWSG: Scott Hirsch\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1300798096618445/", "date": "2017-01-28T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Pointless Improv with Cash & Carry and Improv!

Buie, Assistant Professor/ Section Chair of Printmaking at the College for Creative Studies.\n\nART NOW: PRINTMAKING is the third annual exhibition in the Ann Arbor Art Center\u2019s Art Now Series.  Each year, on a rotating basis, the Ann Arbor Art Center presents a media-focused exhibition as part of the series. We are pleased to present this year's exhibit which features innovative work in printmaking.\n\n\u201cWe deal with printed images every day. Anything that is made in a reproducible format is a print.\u201d  - A Complete Guide to Materials & Processes by Beth Grabowski & Bill Fick\n\nThe field of printmaking is an ever-evolving medium that is deeply engaged in the act of social practice. Printmakers are artists who employ the rich history of printmaking as a basis for the works they create, and are also known to share their methods, facilitate workshops, and create environments where collaboration is welcomed. Although printmaking is considered to be a niche field of study, it is universally known through its traditional and historical processes such as Lithography, Intaglio, Relief, and Screen-printing. Printmaking has paved the way for technology and many digital advances, changing the landscape of the art world, politics and education. Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1936 essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d suggests that a series or an edition is equal to an \u201coriginal\u201d work, which holds an historical perception of uniqueness and authenticity.\n\nWhile some artists are heavily based in traditional modalities of printmaking, other artists will test the limits of what defines a \u201cprint\u201d and push beyond the conventional boundaries, thus allowing for hybrid processes to be employed and combined. The use of such advances include, digital photo-based imaging, sculpture, performance, video, installation, painting and drawing.\n\nThis exhibition will highlight artists that employ traditional printmaking processes, as well as artists who move across disciplines, using \u201cprint\u201d as their foundation, with an emphasis on investigative and exploratory ways of working with the printed image.\n\n-----------\n\nThe 117 Gallery 2016/2017 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1857023781249128/", "date": "2017-02-03T18:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir", "description": "When the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir landed in New York for its first North American tour in 1995 (including a stop in Ann Arbor for UMS\u2019s very first concert at St. Francis), they were known only as the performers on the best-selling CD of fellow-Estonian Arvo P\u00e4rt\u2019s austere Te Deum.\n\nThe concerts showed much more \u2014 a virtuosic ensemble that could dazzle in everything from Bach to folk songs.

Katie will be joined in conversation by Natalie Bakopoulos, author of The Green Shore.\n\nA young woman has agreed with her faithless husband: it\u2019s time for them to separate. For the moment it\u2019s a private matter, a secret between the two of them. As she begins her new life, she gets word that Christopher has gone missing in a remote region in the rugged south of Greece; she reluctantly agrees to go look for him, still keeping their split to herself. In her heart, she\u2019s not even sure if she wants to find him. As her search comes to a shocking breaking point, she discovers she understands less than she thought she did about her relationship and the man she used to love. \n\nA searing, suspenseful story of intimacy and infidelity, A Separation lays bare the gult that divides us from the inner lives of others. With exquisitely cool precision, Katie Kitamura propels us into the experience of a woman on edge, with a fiercely mesmerizing story to tell.\n\n\u201cA slow burn of a novel that gathers its great force and intensity through careful observation and a refusal to accept old, shopworn narratives of love and loss.\u201d \u2014Jenny Offill, author of Dept. of Speculation\n\n\u201cA novel so seamless, that follows its path with such consequence, that even minor deviations seem loaded with meaning.

I had that rare sense of feeling like I was in a creation specifically made out of words, that couldn\u2019t have been made out of any other substance.

This novel is a wonder and a pleasure.\u201d \u2014Rivka Galchen, author of Atmospheric Disturbances and Little Labors\n\n\u201cA Separation opens up fissures of ambiguity in emotional experiences too often misunderstood as monolithic\u2014grief, desire, estrangement\u2014and plumbs these crevices for all their complexities. It has both urgency and afterglow: I read it quickly, but didn\u2019t stop thinking about it for a long time once I was done.\u201d \u2014Leslie Jamison, author of The Empathy Exams\n\nKatie Kitamura is a critic and novelist living in New York City.

In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.  www.tomchapin.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1093572227425292/", "date": "2017-03-03T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Jazz at Lincoln Center with Wynton Marsalis", "description": "\u201cThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis is so far from the usual big-band clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d (Dallas)\n\nSince 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble.

If you need a title to file under try electro-hippie acoustic downtempo.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of definition is that?  It\u2019s the kind of definition that will take you actually going to a show to decide for yourself and put it to your own words.  This element of my life is what I refer to as my day job. Which is essentially me finding new ways to entertain myself on stage in front of an audience.  Using technology and a technique, described by Dr. Didg, as live phrase sampling or looping, I am able to entertain myself for two sets. Nothing is prerecorded and all sounds and beats are created live by layering loops on top of one another and then singing or soloing over top if all if it.\n\nSee what I mean?

March 17 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nElectric 6\nEternal life can seem like an eternity. Ask any vampire. The continuous march of sun ups, sun downs, transformations of form, seductions, cape fittings & exsanguinations. Eventually it all just becomes an endless, tired routine. It all seems so exciting & so sexy to those of us who operate knowing we have limited time. But ask any vampire about the downside of eternal life, & you won't be surprised to hear tales of binge eating garlic bread just to feel the hurt, or of the occasional dangling of a wooden stake just over the center of the rib cage. Electric Six knows all about eternal life. Electric Six has been around forever & it can never die. That's lovely, but it's also very tiring. Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres is the new release by Electric Six on Metropolis Records. One listen & you will immediately understand that the sexiest vampires are urban vampires. Where E6 has dabbled in dance, hip-hop & R&B in the past, Fresh Blood is the whole enchilada. It's thirteen songs designed to make the listener interested in smooth & nasty fuckin', the way they do it in the city. From the Grandmaster Flash-inspired Number Of The Beast to the super smooth tour of the NYC outer boroughs Mood Is Improving, the listener finds himself immediately deposited into an urban drop zone with hustlas & dickblockas coming from behind every corner. The radio-ready pop hits I'll Be In Touch & Dance With Dark Forces are the tracks that get the listener off the street & into the club. & it would not be an Electric Six album without an epic closer, that being the beautiful & haunting Spacewalkin', the ballad that assures the listener that the vampire has now fed & will live a thousand more years, albeit in outer space. Electric Six changes more frequently than change itself, but ultimately this just means they're never gonna put out the same album twice. Fresh Blood for Tired Vampires is poppy & smooth, nasty & raw...& oh so life affirming, especially if you are undead", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1798409430410398/", "date": "2017-03-17T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "You Can Dance: Kidd Pivot", "description": "FREE\n\nJoin dancers from Kidd Pivot  for an exploration of the company\u2019s movement style.\n\nNo dance training or experience necessary, and all levels, ages 13 and up, are welcome.
