During the 1960s, Quebec became radically secular, directly leading to its evolution as a welfare state with lay social services. What happened to cause this abrupt change? Genevieve Zubrzycki gives us an elegant and penetrating history, showing that a key incident sets up the transformation. Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of French Canadians, and, until 1969, was subject of annual celebrations with a parade in Montreal. That year, the statue of St. John was toppled by protestors, breaking off the head from the body. Here, then is the proximate cause: the beheading of a saint, a symbolic death to be sure, which caused the parades to disappear and other modes of national celebration to take their place. The beheading of the saint was part and parcel of the so-called Quiet Revolution, a period of far-reaching social, economic, political, and cultural transformations. Quebec society and the identity of its French-speaking members drastically reinvented themselves with the rejection of Catholicism. Zubrzycki is already acknowledged as a leading authority on nationalism and religion; this book will significantly enlarge her stature by showing the extent to which a core feature of the Quiet Revolution was an aesthetic revolt. A new generation rejected the symbols of French Canada, redefining national identity in the process (and as a process) and providing momentum for institutional reforms. We learn that symbols have causal force, generating chains of significations which can transform a Catholic-dominated conservative society into a leftist, forward-looking, secular society.\n\nGenevi\u00e8ve Zubrzycki is Associate Professor of University of Michigan Sociology and Director of the Weiser Center for Europe and Eurasia at the University of Michigan. Born and raised in Quebec City, she was educated at McGill University and the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al before obtaining her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. Her work examines politics and religion, nationalism, as well as national mythology and the politics of commemorations. Her publications include the award-winning The Crosses of Auschwitz: Nationalism and Religion in Post-Communist Poland (University of Chicago Press, 2006); Beheading the Saint: Nationalism, Religion and Secularism in Quebec (University of Chicago Press, 2016); and National Matters: Nationalism, Culture and Materiality (forthcoming, Stanford University Press.). She is now completing a third monograph on the current revival of Jewish communities in Poland and non-Jewish Poles\u2019 interest in all things Jewish. She has published articles on the topic in Comparative Studies in History and Society and the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. Her scholarship was awarded prizes from the Association for Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies, the Polish Studies Association, and from the American Sociological Association\u2019s sections on Sociology of Culture, Political Sociology, Sociology of Religion, and Collective Behavior and Social Movements.\n\nEvent date: \nFriday, December 9, 2016 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \n124 E.

Sign up for the street team by clicking here: http://bit.ly/2b3tDvt\n\nDOPAPOD: \n\nThe Boston born, now generally Northeast based, but ever on-the-go Dopapod has come a long way from their college basement, DIY party roots. While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "name": "Dopapod & Pigeons Playing Ping Pong at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1574155032886638/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-15T08:00:00-05:00", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

An accomplished instrumentalist, she began playing the classical guitar at 11. Influenced by edIT, Bonobo, The Widdler and Amon Tobin, she started producing electronic music at the age of 16.\n\nIn 2014, she won the 'Best International Newcomer of 2013' at the UK Glitch-Hop Award.\n\nHer tracks defy genres, oscillating between World Bass, Tribal Trap, Glitch-Hop, Trip-Hop, and Downtempo. She created her own place in the glitch community, thanks to a unique, highly surprising style, mixing powerful basslines, funky off beat percussion and emotional cinematic sounds. A musical identity which led her to play in the USA (including the festivals Coachella, Lightning In A Bottle, Shambhala...), Canada, India, Berlin, and more than 30 cities in France, alongside artists like Bonobo, Gramatik, Chet Faker, Tipper, TOKiMONSTA, Tipper, Big Gigantic, GRiZ...\n\nRunner-up of several remix contests (launched by artists like Mr. Bill, Asian Trash Boy, Crazy Daylight, Daenine...), CloZee was spotted by respected labels such as Gravitas Recordings, Glitch Hop Community, Adapted Records, Digital Whomp, Empathy Recordings, MOR Records, Waxhole Records\u2026 \n\nWebsite - http://www.clozeemusic.com/\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/clozee\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/CloZee \n\nPsymbionic\nCresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound.\n\nJohn Burcham has been moving bodies and turning heads as Psymbionic for several years in all corners of the USA, playing with acts such as Bassnectar, STS9, Big Gigantic, ill.Gates, Excision, EOTO, and Tipper. His passion and innovation in the music world are showcased through album releases on Muti Music and MalLabel, as well as in his role as label manager for the popular Electronic imprint Gravitas Recordings.\n\nIn a live show context, Psymbionic confronts mixes that are limited to the scope of the build and release, avoiding an industry epidemic of drop-monotony that overpowers the flow of music. Burcham seeks to prove that there are more powerful influences in moving a crowd than simple tension, providing an interwoven dynamic that relies on the strength of his blend, rather than the sole force or familiarity of the apex.\n\nPsymbionic's theory of music is a journey that doesn't visit the same place twice, building excitement for what's next not because you can anticipate it, but because you've never been there before.\n\nWebsite - http://www.psymbionicmusic.com/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/psymbionic\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/psymbionic", "name": "CloZee & Psymbionic - Biohackers Tour at Necto - 12/15", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1417695524925106/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-15T21:30:00-05:00", "description": "Dead Hit will be back at the Blind Pig - Ann Arbor, MI on Thursday, December 15 for an evening of live music.

Enter the sinister doctor, the Ultramagnetic visionary, Kool Keith, whose \"Feature Magnetic,\" released Sept. 16 on Mello Music Group, is his latest bizarre transformative odyssey .\n\nAs always, Keith seems unstuck in time, oblivious to geography, brilliantly mixed unflinchingly grim details with surreal, fantastical tangents. He\u2019s from the Bronx, but belongs to far-reaching astral dimensions. And Where many of his contemporaries have become legacy acts or revivalists, Keith continues to originate and perfect his wild style. He\u2019s parked behind Oracle Arena in Oakland with Norah Jones -- riding a horse and carriage through Central Park (bystanders shout that he looks like Mike Tyson). He drinks with MF DOOM in dusty London basement and recruits a legendary squadron of fellow travelers including Sadat X (Brand Nubian), Bumpy Knuckles, Boston pioneer Ed O.G., Slug from Atmosphere, and Vallejo legend Mac Mall.\n\nWSG: Kosha Dillz", "name": "Kool Keith w/ Kosha Dillz 12/16/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/319661255066863/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-16T22:00:00-05:00", "description": "Our League of Pointless Improvisers will invite audience members and performers to share their holiday tales, and will then create an improvised show based on these. \nNo two shows are the same! \nTickets are $10.", "name": "Crazy Holiday Feats", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/718892291596571/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-17T09:00:00-05:00", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

In 1994, Tim and Denise Duffy started the Music Makers Relief Foundation to provide financial support to Southern working class musicians, ensuring that their legacies and music will be preserved. Limited by age and abject poverty, many of these artists have almost given up hope when instead they should be celebrated and recorded into history.\n\nJust like the Music Makers have brought back musicways embedded in American roots, Zingerman\u2019s Roadhouse has strived to connect with foodways that are steeped in American culture. Chef Alex Young has collaborated with our special guest, Music Makers member Dom Flemons from The Carolina Chocolate Drops, to create a dinner that reflects the music of the very artists the foundation has helped promote. Come by and taste the BBQ that Drink Small praises in his song, \u201cLiving in a BBQ World\u201d, and the buttery biscuits that Algia Mae Hinton sings about in \u201cBiscuits for your Outside Man\u201d.

At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "name": "Hiss Golden Messenger 1/28/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1300798096618445/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-01-29T15:00:00-05:00", "description": "Heidi Andermack, born in Michigan, co-founded Chowgirls Killer Catering in 2004.

In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.\ntomchapin.com", "name": "Tom Chapin at Green Wood Coffee House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1093572227425292/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-03-04T20:00:00-05:00", "description": "\u201cThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis is so far from the usual big-band clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d (Dallas)\n\nSince 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble.

After years of caring for her ungrateful mother, Maureen has little hope of happiness or escape, especially after Mag ruins her first, and perhaps only, chance of a loving relationship. This is confrontational theater at its most potent, with characters locked in mortal combat and mutual loathing.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/the-beauty-queen-of-leenane/", "name": "The Beauty Queen of Leenane: Druid", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/614995318650187/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-03-13T00:00:00-04:00", "description": "Can't make it to Ann Arbor on March 26?
