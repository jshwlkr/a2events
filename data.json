October 16 | 9pm | 18+ |  $10 Cover\n\nSaintseneca\u2019s powerful new album Such Things is the band\u2019s most cohesive, catchy and accessible output, and a work that solidifies the group\u2019s singer and songwriter Zac Little\u2019s status as one of modern indie music\u2019s most thoughtful and talented artists. The record arrives October 9th via Anti-.\n\nThe first single, \u201cSleeper Hold\u201d is a pulsating and infectious rock song that utilizes elements of punk, folk and straight up rock and roll, all centered around a soaring and beautifully anthemic chorus.\n\nSuch Things is the anticipated follow up to Saintseneca\u2019s acclaimed album Dark Arc, which Stereogum celebrated writing, \u201cDark Arc shines in all the ways Saintseneca always has \u2014 gorgeous harmonies, rampant strumming, glimpses of both humanity\u2019s fragility and power \u2014 but it also finds the band branching out into fuller arrangements and wilder instrumentation. (Wilder, even, than the plastic trash can they used to beat on.) It\u2019s what an underground folk band stepping into the spotlight should sound like.\u201d\n\nMoving away from the cinematic, linear quality of Dark Arc, Little sought even higher ground for the new songs, and to incorporate the synapses and charges of his fellow members. \u201cI was pushing myself with Such Things to try to explore the pop motif further, to try to use and bend that formula of having a groove, a beat, locking in and using that as scaffolding to build a song,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd even though it oftentimes might seem like this singular vision, at the core my creative strategy for the band is one that inherently involves other people. I think the best work I\u2019ll make involves working that way.\u201d\n\nThose disparate pieces and parts have come together, like so many molecules, to form a solid rock object called Such Things. You can hold it in your hands and hear it in your head, this culmination of tiny, beautiful moments and fluctuations of energy and information, compressed and etched into an LP sleeve and eternity and all tied up in a rock and roll record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a new way of songs manifesting, and it feels like a step forward,\u201d Little says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna push myself and try this thing I\u2019ve wanted to try. I think it\u2019s the best thing we\u2019ve done so far, but then again I won\u2019t write a song that I don\u2019t think isn\u2019t the best thing I\u2019ve done. When I finish it I have to feel like it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve made. And if I don\u2019t feel that way, it\u2019s like, why bother?\u201d\nwith: The Sidekicks & Yowler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/464", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/719914338112732/"}, {"name": "Washtenaw County Clean Up Day", "date": "2015-10-17T09:00:00-04:00", "description": "Ypsilanti: Saturday, October 17th, 2015, 9am-2pm\n799 N.

Rapper AK started rapping at 11 years old and his partner Issa Gold started 6 years ago. Raised together in Flatbush, Brooklyn, they established THE UNDERACHIEVERS in 2011 and have been creating music together ever since. In May 2012, the group released their debut video for \"So Devilish\" and everything began to take off from there. Since then, the group has gained more than 24 million views on YouTube, 125,000+ YouTube subscribers and solid reviews from all of the top music publications. The Underachievers released the critically acclaimed INDIGOISM in February of 2013. The debut mix tape received an eight out of ten from Pitchfolk.com and has since gone PLATINUM on DatPiff. The mix tape has been downloaded over 300k times and has accumulated over 745k views on the unique website. It has been heralded as one of the best projects of 2013 and it has served as an excellent tool to establish the reputation of the group. In August of 2013, UA released their second project \"The Lords of Flatbush\" produced entirely by the extraordinary producer LEX LUGER. Again the mix tape was released on DatPiff and it amassed over 155k downloads making it a GOLD release on the site. In 2014, the group headlined their first tour \u201cEyes of the World\u201d across North America, Canada & Europe. In August of the same year, UA also released their debut album on the RPM MSC label entitled \"Cellar Door: Terminus Ut Exordium\". The album charted #16 on R&B/Hip-Hop Album chart, #12 on INDI Album chart, #11 on Rap Album chart and #86 on the Billboard 200 album chart in its first week. The main purpose of UA\u2019s music is to aide in the enlightenment of their generation by providing music from a perspective that all can appreciate and enjoy but still keeping it positive and as \"true to hip hop\" as they can. By combining their strong points they have been able to establish themselves as a rising reputable force in Hip Hop and the music Industry. The Underachievers wrapped up 2014 with a co-headline tour across North America & Canada joining Flatbush Zombies for a jaunt dubbed \"Clockwork Indigo Presents The Electric Koolade Experience\". The Duo is set to pick up the second leg of \"The Electric Koolade Experience\" tour in Europe from March through April 2015.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/125351747800708/"}, {"name": "Come as You Are: Art of the 1990s", "date": "2015-10-17T23:00:00-04:00", "description": "Come as You Are: Art of the 1990s, the first major museum survey to examine the art of this pivotal decade in its historical context, showcases over 64 works by 46 artists born or practicing in the United States.

He'll read from his latest story collection, The Tsar of Love and Techno.\n\nThe NY Times called this collection a \"miracle of a book\". \n\nThis stunning, exquisitely written collection introduces a cast of remarkable characters whose lives intersect in ways both life-affirming and heartbreaking. A 1930s Soviet censor painstakingly corrects offending photographs, deep underneath Leningrad, bewitched by the image of a disgraced prima ballerina. A chorus of women recount their stories and those of their grandmothers, former gulag prisoners who settled their Siberian mining town. Two pairs of brothers share a fierce, protective love. Young men across the former USSR face violence at home and in the military. And great sacrifices are made in the name of an oil landscape unremarkable except for the almost incomprehensibly peaceful past it depicts. In stunning prose, with rich character portraits and a sense of history reverberating into the present, The Tsar of Love and Techno is a captivating work from one of our greatest new talents.\n\nAnthony Marra is the author of A Constellation of Vital Phenomena (2013), which won the National Book Critics Circle\u2019s inaugural John Leonard Prize, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award in fiction, the Barnes and Noble Discover Award, and appeared on over twenty year-end lists.

They sought to make the kind of music they wanted to hear and in the process created something uniquely their own.\n\nBy 1995 they released their self-titled debut and toured the underground scene in nonstop support of their work, playing everywhere from basements and coffee shops to Gilman Street with bands such as Knapsack, Giant\u2019s Chair, and Christie Front Drive. The following year brought further collaboration with Front Drive in a split 10\u201d. With a growing fan base in an emerging genre, they were ready to create their second album, Departures and Landfalls.\n\nWhile on tour, the band became a tighter unit and developed focus by talking about music and planning their future creative direction. They all saw Departures as their first opportunity to document new songs that could help define an original sound. With stronger songcraft, a refined tone, and a solid creative process, the work they created remained abrasive but also incorporated warmth and depth.\n\nGeography and seasons affected the process; some songs were written on the road, with an ever-changing landscape, and many during the springtime and early summer. Late nights of long drives, longer talks, and doing what you love are what made Departures Boys Life\u2019s first real record, full of new but classic sounds. They had made something of their own.\n\nDuring five days of a hot summer in Chicago in 1996, they recorded with Bob Weston in the home studio of Steve Albini. In the band\u2019s maturity, they were rehearsing almost daily and decided to record the album live. Several first takes made the final cut, and the resulting songs sounded natural and organic, reflecting the true dynamic of the band and their live performance.\n\nAfter the record\u2019s release, Boys Life co-headlined tours with Kerosene 454 and Bluetip. Their performances were loud, enthusiastic, and genuine, and the experience strengthened the band\u2019s newfound bonds with those in DC sharing the same postpunk ethic. By the end of that touring cycle, however, citing exhaustion, they called it a day in the summer of 1997.\n\nNow, nearly twenty years later, Boys Life is ready to revisit their records with renewed energy. Both the band and their songs were products of a special time that can\u2019t be replicated, only revisited. But then and now, both Boys Life and Departures and Landfalls reflect something more than nostalgia\u2014creativity, the power of music, the roar of a thunderstorm, and the lonesome sound of a train whistle.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/398616826996922/"}, {"name": "Skazat!

Mistaken for a famous but reclusive author of the same name, lonely Shriver attends a writers\u2019 conference at a small Midwestern liberal arts college. Completely unfamiliar with the novel he supposedly wrote and utterly unprepared for the magnitude of the reputation that precedes him, Shriver is feted, fawned over, featured at stuffy literary panels, and barely manages to play it cool. Things quickly go awry when one of the other guest authors suddenly disappears and Shriver becomes a prime suspect in the investigation. Amidst eager fans, Shriver must contend with a persistent police detective, a pesky journalist determined to unearth his past, and a mysterious and possibly dangerous stalker who seems to know his secret. But most vexing of all, Shriver\u2019s gone and fallen in love with the conference organizer, who believes he\u2019s someone else.\n\n\"Chris Belden's Shriver is as hilarious and smart as Michael Malone's Foolscap, as wise and sympathetic as Stoner.

As was the case in the 1980s, contemporary art in the 1990s continued to diversify itself in terms of medium, materiality, and concept.  And, like before, many artists concerned themselves with \u201cidentity,\u201d the social and libidinal construction of what was formerly called the \u201csubject.\u201d   But even more intensely than before, artists began to engage with digital technologies, including photography, video, computers, and the Internet; and through these media, a new fluidity, immersiveness, and interest in the world and politics entered art.  In addition, the art world globalized during the 1990s, its conversation growing to include a variety of perspectives that previously had not been heard.  Symposium participants, including Come as You Are exhibition curator Alexandra Schwartz, have been selected to represent the diversity and range of art in the 1990s. They include both those who came of age in the 1990s as well as those whose professional careers took root amidst the struggles over multiculturalism, freedom of expression, and personal choice in the 1980s.  Accordingly, this symposium is intended to historicize the visual art of the 1990s by placing it within a longue dur\u00e9e of multiple, overlapping filaments whose implications are only just being realized today.\n\nHuey Copeland\nAssociate Professor of Art History and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Northwestern University\n\nHolly Hughes\nPerformance Artist and Playwright, Professor of Art and Design, Theatre and Drama at the University of Michigan\n\nSuzanne Hudson\nAssociate Professor of Art History and Fine Arts, University of Southern California\n\nLane Relyea\nAssociate Professor and Chair, Department of Art Theory & Practice, Northwestern University\n\nAlexandra Schwartz\nCurator of Contemporary Art, The Montclair Art Museum, and curator of the exhibition Come as You Are: Art of the 1990s on view at UMMA October 17, 2015\u2013January 31, 2016.\n\nEve Sussman\nArtist\n\nJohn Tain\nCurator of Modern and Contemporary Art, Collections Development, The Getty Research Institute\n\t\n\tThis symposium is presented by the U-M History of Art Department and co-sponsored by UMMA.\n\tLead support for the exhibition Come as You Are: Art of the 1990s is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.

October 24 | 18+ | 9pm | $12 adv. $14 Day of \n\nLanghorne Slim\nwith Fort Frances\n\nThere is nothing like the challenges and camaraderie of the road to inspire a songwriter who thrives upon the emotional energy and exhilaration only travel can deliver. Some singers are devoted to the pursuit of perpetual motion, and Langhorne Slim releases his wild soul in ways that come out of the discipline of live performance.\n\nThe 13 songs that compose Langhorne Slim & The Law's new \"The Way We Move\" are road-tested, rollicking and very rock 'n' rolling tunes that the songwriter perfected with his loyal band, and come out of the kind of good times and bad experiences that songwriters of Langhorne's lofty stature can turn into life-affirming rock 'n' roll. You could also call what Langhorne Slim does folk music, but then there's his sly, charming and open-hearted feel for pop music -- those summertime melodies that nudge you into a grin even when the song is about something bad.\n\nFor Langhorne Slim -- Pennsylvania-born self-taught guitarist who moves to Brooklyn at 18, begins feeling out his place in a burgeoning punk-folk scene, wends his way to the West Coast, and finds himself celebrated from Newport to Portland as one of today's most original singers and songwriters -- \"The Way We Move\" represents the sound of a band devoted to living in the moment. Riding the success of his 2009 full-length Be Set Free, Langhorne went through some changes over the last three years -- he lost his beloved grandfather, who is the subject of the new record's moving \"Song for Sid,\" and moved on from a relationship that had lasted five years.\n\nAnd there was the physical moving -- the literal side of the record's title. Pulling up stakes from his home of two years, Portland, Ore., Langhorne also has been touring non-stop with The Law. As he says, \"I'm in a bit of a transitional period -- currently, the road will be home. That's just kind of my spirit, to be slightly restless.\" Perfecting their rangy sound out on the endless grey ribbon, Langhorne and The Law -- bassist Jeff Ratner, drummer Malachi DeLorenzo and banjo player and keyboardist David Moore -- went down to rural Texas in the summer of 2011 to work on new material. With some 30 tunes to consider, the quartet soaked up the Lone Star sunshine and developed arrangements and approaches for Langhorne's latest batch of songs.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/843147115782248/"}, {"name": "Dirty Deville at Wolverine State Brewing Co", "date": "2015-10-24T21:00:00-04:00", "description": "Come out and celebrate the return of Massacre with Wolverine State Brewing Co. and Dirty Deville!

A few key examples: Radiohead \u2013 Kid A, R.E.M. \u2013 Lifes Rich Pageant, Talking Heads \u2013 Remain in Light, Wilco \u2013 Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, David Bowie \u2013 Hunky Dory ... you see where we're going with this. Album four is an opportunity for artists to reinvent, and frequently revitalize, themselves.

It\u2019s like a Tarantino remake of The Harder They Come but with a soundtrack by Bob Marley and a script by Oliver Stone and William Faulkner, with maybe a little creative boost from some primo ganja. It\u2019s epic in every sense of that word: sweeping, mythic, over-the-top, colossal and dizzyingly complex. It\u2019s also raw, dense, violent, scalding, darkly comic, exhilarating and exhausting\u2014a testament to Mr. James\u2019s vaulting ambition and prodigious talent.\u201d\n\u2014The New York Times \n\nIn A Brief History of Seven Killings, Marlon James combines brilliant storytelling with his unrivaled skills of characterization and meticulous eye for detail to forge an enthralling novel of dazzling ambition and scope.\n\nOn December 3, 1976, just before the Jamaican general election and two days before Bob Marley was to play the Smile Jamaica Concert to ease political tensions in Kingston, seven gunmen stormed the singer\u2019s house, machine guns blazing. The attack wounded Marley, his wife, and his manager, and injured several others. Little was officially released about the gunmen, but much has been whispered, gossiped and sung about in the streets of West Kingston. Rumors abound regarding the assassins\u2019 fates, and there are suspicions  that the attack was politically motivated.\n\nA Brief History of Seven Killings delves deep into that dangerous and unstable time in Jamaica\u2019s history and beyond. James deftly chronicles the lives of a host of unforgettable characters \u2013 gunmen, drug dealers, one-night stands, CIA agents,  even ghosts \u2013 over the course of thirty years as they roam the streets of 1970s Kingston, dominate the crack houses of 1980s New York, and ultimately reemerge into the radically altered Jamaica of the 1990s. Along the way, they learn that evil does indeed cast long shadows, that justice and retribution are inextricably linked, and that no one can truly escape his fate.\n\nGripping and inventive, shocking and irresistible, A Brief History of Seven Killings is a mesmerizing modern classic of power, mystery, and insight.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1687639351466507/"}, {"name": "UMMA & Penny W.

As part of a group of 1980s artists known as Neo-Expressionists (a term that he would reject), Schnabel wanted to return to painting pre-abstraction, and forged a practice that encompassed figuration, personal narratives, and references to history and mythology.  His paintings, sculptures, and works on paper have been the subject of numerous exhibitions at museums worldwide, including the current exhibition of his work at the University of Michigan Museum of Art (on view through September 27). Also a renowned filmmaker, in 1996 Schnabel wrote and directed the feature film Basquiat about artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, produced by Peter Brant.

Nov. 13 | 9pm | 18+ | $25 adv./ $30 day of\n\nVanessa Carlton\nwith: Joshua Hyslop\n\nAn unusual light shines through Liberman, Vanessa Carlton\u2019s fifth album. Its ten songs, built on ethereal melodies and lush orchestration, seem to climb out of the shadows, each resonating with a sense of haunting positivity.  The opening track, \u201cTake It Easy,\u201d instantly sets the tone, inviting the listener into a sort of sonic euphoria: each note and lyric thereafter builds on that aesthetic, creating an ongoing narrative that unfurls over its classic side A and side B. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a calm record,\u201d Carlton says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want any angst in there. I thought, \u2018What would I want to hear back? What would make me feel better in my darker times?\u2019 Even a phrase like \u2018take it easy,\u2019 which is in a million songs, brings happiness. This album leans toward seeing the good in humans and in the world.\u201d  \n\nCarlton began writing in the summer of 2012, beginning with \u201cUnlock The Lock,\u201d an evocative piano-driven track that set the tone for the songs to come. She\u2019d recently finished touring 2011\u2019s Rabbits On The Run, an album conceived through inspiration from Stephen Hawking\u2019s A Brief History of Time and Richard Adam\u2019s Watership Down. Carlton found herself in the desert and the song emerged, reflecting a newly revealing songwriting sensibility for the artist. \u201cI imagined a group of people listening to it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the first time I ever wanted to make something like s\u00e9ance music \u2013 something that would make a human brain feel at ease, something that would feel right in an everyday ritual. I also realized I wanted the record to be really soothing lyrically and not so much a reveal of me.\u201d\n\nThe musician followed that thread as she continued writing for the next year and a half, this time inspired by books like Joseph Campbell\u2019s The Power of Myth and Aldous Huxley\u2019s The Doors of Perception. Carlton\u2019s primary influence, however, was a colorful oil painting by her grandfather Alan J. Lee, who was originally named Liberman. The painting, created in 1963, hangs in Carlton\u2019s home and showcases three woman captured in swirling pastel colors. She wrote many songs while looking at the image, eventually deciding to call the album after her grandfather. \n\n\u201cThe swirly colors of that painting reminded me of the music and the music reminds me of those colors\u201d Carlton notes. \u201cThen I looked up what Liberman means and it\u2019s \u2018honorable man\u2019 and \u2018my beloved\u2019 \u2013 all these things that just felt right to me. It\u2019s a strong family name that, in a weird way, describes the music to me.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2013, Carlton gathered her songs and decamped to Real World Studio in Box, England to work with producer Steve Osborne, who\u2019d helmed Rabbits On The Run. In the studio, Carlton and Osborne focused on the sound, on creating layers of instrumentation with classic gear that veer away from crisp pop production and reference artists like Air. For Carlton, who began her career with several albums at the mercy of prescribed aesthetics, emphasizing the art of space and sonic beauty felt like the next step. This shift is revealed particularly in the trippy ambience of \u201cHouse of Seven Swords\u201d and the moody \u201cAscension,\u201d which builds a soundscape outward from the piano at its center. \n\nCarlton rounded out the album in Nashville, the city she now calls home, with producer Adam Landry who worked on three tracks. Carlton\u2019s husband, Deer Tick front man John McCauley, played on several songs throughout the process, including \u201cTake it Easy,\u201d \"Ascension\" and \u201cMatter of Time.\u201d The latter is stripped of instrumentation and highlights Carlton\u2019s voice as it soars over McCauley\u2019s delicately plucked electric guitar, reminiscent of the old school vocal recordings of Dusty Springfield.  As a whole, Liberman feels like a new chapter in Carlton\u2019s storied career, revealing new facets of her musical skill and instigating fresh inspirations. Stagnancy, she knows, is the antithesis to creativity. \n\n\u201cMartin Scorsese said sometimes your greatest challenge is not your failure but your success,\u201d Carlton says. \u201cIn a way I was able to persevere after having a success out of the gate and figure out a path that feels really pure to me. But I had to create this environment where I felt comfortable changing. When I was first doing records I was so young and I wanted to please everyone. But now I sort of feel ancient and I love it and I just want to make art for its own sake. Whether I fall on my face or not at least I know I did it. Everything I\u2019ve done and everything I am is there in the songs.\u201d", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1651671698445679/"}, {"name": "Build A Toy", "date": "2015-11-14T13:00:00-05:00", "description": "Captain Midnight opens his personal toy colelction for you to rip apart, mod, and create anew!

Bringing together like\u00adminded players and friends, he and his able\u00adminded Freaks crafted two separate albums of material, a low\u00adkey self\u00adtitled release in 2009 and a more full\u00adbodied 2013 record entitled How Far Away.\n\nAlex Bleeker and the Freaks\u2019 third album Country Agenda is the culmination of Bleeker\u2019s songwriting, as well as the gelling together of a fully formed band. With the full\u00adtime inclusion of guitarist Alex Steinberg, bassist Nick Lenchner, drummer Dylan Shumaker and keyboardist Jacob Wolf, along with occasional guest vocals from Mountain Man singer Molly Sarle, The Freaks\u2019 vibe has coalesced considerably.\n\nNo longer the work of a single director, this version of the band gives the songs more room to breathe, allowing the tunes to move in unexpected directions. A wholly collaborative effort, Country Agenda features multiple songwriters and ensemble playing that stretches out in unhurried passages of glowing musical interplay. The songs wander in slow motion like a coastline drive, drawing on the same wizened energy and brilliant restraint as Crazy Horse, the Dead, Moby Grape and other like\u00adminded cosmic travelers. Easily the most realized and best sounding set of tunes from the project, the strengths of the album are magnified by a cohesive feeling that was absent on previous Freaks records. The sound here is undeniably the birth of a solid band playing together, locked in the groove, and moving down the road in unison.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/502", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/820090691422005/"}, {"name": "Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band w/ The Erers 11/21/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2015-11-21T21:00:00-05:00", "description": "The Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band bridges genres and eras with an intensity and effortlessness few contemporary artists possess. And their new album So Deliciouselevates the trio\u2019s work to a new level. Produced by Rev. Peyton, So Delicious offers the band\u2019s most diverse collection of songs buoyed by the Rev.\u2019s supercharged six-string virtuosity \u2014 a unique style of fingerpicking inspired by his Delta blues heroes, but taken to new, original heights.\n\nThe fifth full-length original album by the group \u2014 which includes Breezy Peyton on washboard and supporting vocals and Ben Bussell on drums and supporting vocals \u2014 is their debut on Yazoo Records, a label known for the historic reissues of blues and other old time American music that are the bedrock inspiration for the Rev.\u2019s sound and approach.\n\n\u201cYazoo was my favorite record label growing up,\u201d he explains. \u201cFor fans of old country blues and all manner of early American music, they are the quintessential label. And for me, it\u2019s like being on the same label as Charley Patton and \u2018Mississippi\u2019 John Hurt. To think that Yazoo believes we are authentic enough to stand with the other people in their catalog means a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band has always been strong on authenticity, playing music that blends blues, ragtime, folk, country and other traditional styles with the sleek modern energy of do-it-yourself, homespun, punk fueled rock. And performing tunes plucked from their lives, their community or from the canonical songbook that fed the Rev. Peyton\u2019s formative creative identity. It\u2019s a mix that\u2019s allowed the band to win fans from all corners of the Americana and rock worlds, and bring a new generation to blues and other forms of American roots music.\n\nSo Delicious is a perfect Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band album, with songs that speak from the heart and capture the trio \u2014 whose sound has been honed over 250 annual tour dates during the last eight years \u2014 playing at their peak. The charging, anthemic \u201cRaise a Little Hell,\u201d also the set\u2019s first video, lays out the band\u2019s live modus operandi, thriving on Bussell\u2019s and Breezy\u2019s chugging beat and the Rev.\u2019s resonator guitar riffs and mantra-like singing. The song was inspired by a show at a folk festival, where one of the promoters \u2014 struck by the Big Damn Band\u2019s raucous, juke joint power \u2014 told the Rev., \u201cY\u2019all sure raise a lot of hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Naw we don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201c the Rev. recalls. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe we do raise a little hell.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sweet, joyful \u201cPot Roast & Kisses,\u201d which the band has also committed to video, was written for Breezy. The Rev. was developing the finger-busting main riff after enjoying one of her pot roast dinners when the lyrics naturally fell into place. \u201cSome people don\u2019t believe that we really live the way we sing about in our songs,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut it\u2019s true. Breezy and me are together and really love each other.
