A social novel about engagements and in-laws, a satire of the medical-industrial complex, an impassioned defense of squirrels... McKenzie can do it all and does, in vibrant, gleeful, somersaulting prose. Her heroine--the titular Veblen--might not be quite as quick-witted and ambitious as her author, but she's impossible not to root for. And trust me, you'll never look at squirrels the same way again.\"\n\n\nSet in and around Palo Alto, amid the culture clash of new money and old (antiestablishment) values, and with the specter of our current wars looming across its pages, The Portable Veblen is an unforgettable look at the way we live now. A young couple on the brink of marriage the charming Veblen and her fianc\u00e9 Paul, a brilliant neurologist find their engagement in danger of collapse. Along the way they weather everything from each other\u2019s dysfunctional families, to the attentions of a seductive pharmaceutical heiress, to an intimate tete-a-tete with a very charismatic squirrel.\n\nVeblen (named after the iconoclastic economist Thorstein Veblen, who coined the term conspicuous consumption ) is one of the most refreshing heroines in recent fiction. Not quite liberated from the burdens of her hypochondriac, narcissistic mother and her institutionalized father, Veblen is an amateur translator and freelance self; in other words, she\u2019s adrift.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul the product of good hippies who were bad parents finds his ambition soaring. His medical research has led to the development of a device to help minimize battlefield brain trauma an invention that gets him swept up in a high-stakes deal with the Department of Defense, a Bizarro World that McKenzie satirizes with granular specificity.\n\nAs Paul is swept up by the promise of fame and fortune, Veblen heroically keeps the peace between all the damaged parties involved in their upcoming wedding, until she finds herself falling for someone or something else. Throughout, Elizabeth McKenzie asks: Where do our families end and we begin? How do we stay true to our ideals? And what is that squirrel really thinking? Replete with deadpan photos and sly appendices, The Portable Veblen is at once an honest inquiry into what we look for in love and an electrifying reading experience.\n\n\u201cMan oh man, do I love this book! I have never read anything like it. I can't believe how funny it is given that we're dealing at times with pharmaceutical fraud, irreparable brain injury, and comatose veterans. (Family dysfunction, on the other hand, is always funny) Audacious, imaginative, and totally wonderful: The whole books zips and zings. -Karen Joy Fowler, PEN Faulkner winner for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves.\n\n\"The Portable Veblen is the squirreliest novel I ever read. I enjoyed it completely.\u201d -Ursula K. Le Guin, author of The Dispossessed and The Left Hand of Darkness.\n\nElizabeth McKenzie is the author of a collection, Stop That Girl, short-listed for The Story Prize, and the novel MacGregor Tells the World, a \"Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle and Library Journal Best Book of the year. Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Best American Nonrequired Reading, and the Pushcart Prize anthology, and has been recorded for NPR's Selected Shorts. She was an NEA/Japan US-Friendship Commission Fellow in 2010. She received her MA from Stanford, was an assistant fiction editor at \"he Atlantic, and currently teaches creative writing at Stanford's school of continuing studies.\n\nPhoto credit: Chuck Kramer", "name": "Elizabeth McKenzie", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-02-02T19:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1560753257579168/"}, {"description": "Tuesday, February 2, 2016, 7:30 pm\nLydia Mendelssohn Theatre\n\nWith Tanya Tagaq, ancient meets modern in provocative, powerful ways.

Tagaq\u2019s mixed-media performance reclaims the controversial classic \u2014 considered the first feature-length documentary \u2014 capturing the sense of the sound of the Arctic spaces shown in the film and adding tremendous feeling and depth to what is a complex mix of beautiful representations and racially charged clich\u00e9s.\n\nTanya Tagaq\u2019s music is unnerving and exquisite, rooted in Inuit throat singing, but also influenced by electronica, industrial, and metal influences.

A 24-Decade History of Popular Music will eventually become a 24-hour extravaganza focused on music popular in America between 1776-2016, with an hour devoted to each decade. Clad in glittering, over-the-top drag, Mac brings an incomparable voice and high-voltage stage presence to an alternate version of American histories, brought to life through a gleefully subversive mash-up of performance art and song. Here, Mac focuses on the period 1956-1986, with chapters devoted to Songs Popular on the Bus/The March on Washington, Stonewall Songs, and Songs Popular in the Backroom. Selections will include songs made popular by Nina Simone and Stevie Wonder, among others.\n\nPlease note: Taylor Mac\u2019s cabaret will include mature sexual content and is intended for adult audiences.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/taylor-mac-a-24-decade-history-of-american-popular-music-1960s-1980s/", "name": "Taylor Mac: A 24-Decade History of Popular Music: 1956\u20131986", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-02-05T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1594841967471096/"}, {"description": "Following four sold-out shows in November, Ann Arbor Civic Theatre and the Civic Improv Ensemble are excited to announce the second Improv Showcase of their 2015-16 season.

There he meets Mitko, a charismatic young hustler, and pays him for sex. He returns to Mitko again and again over the next few months, drawn by hunger and loneliness and risk, and finds himself ensnared in a relationship in which lust leads to mutual predation, and tenderness can transform into violence. As he struggles to reconcile his longing with the anguish it creates, he\u2019s forced to grapple with his own fraught history, the world of his southern childhood where to be queer was to be a pariah. There are unnerving similarities between his past and the foreign country he finds himself in, a country whose geography and griefs he discovers as he learns more of Mitko\u2019s own narrative, his private history of illness, exploitation, and want.\n\nWhat Belongs to You is a stunning debut novel of desire and its consequences. With lyric intensity and startling eroticism, Garth Greenwell has created an indelible story about the ways in which our pasts and cultures, our scars and shames can shape who we are and determine how we love.\n\n\u201cGarth Greenwell takes us deep inside a specific Bulgarian subculture to examine the universal: the disparity between the uninhibited lives we desire and the bearable lives we choose.

Percy James\u2019s search launches a complicated series of events, triggered by an unexpected discovery that threatens her very survival. \u201cThere\u2019s a big old neon heart pulsing on every page of SWEETGIRL, like the sign to a bar you can\u2019t help but enter,\u201d says Lindsay Hunter, author of Ugly Girls and Don't Kiss Me. \u201cI felt thrilled and shocked, and I couldn\u2019t stop turning the pages. Travis Mulhauser is a writer to be reckoned with.\u201d\n\nNine days after Mama disappeared I heard she was throwing down with Shelton Potter. As a blizzard bears down, Percy James sets off to find her troubled mother. For years, Percy has had to take care of herself and Mama\u2014a woman who\u2019s been unraveling for as long as her daughter can remember. In a drug-ravaged farmhouse, Percy finds a neglected infant, and risks everything to save her. But, her decision puts her on the wrong side of Potter, a volatile ex-con who puts a bounty on the young girl\u2019s head. As Percy disappears into the surrounding, isolated hill country, she will face a journey requiring plenty of courage and ingenuity, even as she confronts the nature of her mother\u2019s affliction and the realities of life in a community devastated by meth addiction and the desperation that accompanies it.\n\n\"Percy actually started as a supporting character in another book, which I basically scrapped when I realized she was the one I was really interested in writing about,\u201d Mulhauser says of the genesis of SWEETGIRL. \u201cI think her story really came together through her voice, which I would say is heavily influenced by two experiences: a few years working with addict and \u2018at risk teens\u2019 in northern Michigan and seven years teaching at a small community college in North Carolina. Both of these experiences exposed me to really tough, vibrant kids who spoke with conviction and bluster, who were often hopeful despite difficult circumstances, and who, generally, did not imbue their very harrowing life experiences with much self-pity or melodrama.\u201d\n\nTravis Mulhauser was born and raised in Northern Michigan, the insular and remote setting of the fictional Cutler County of the novel. Currently, Mulhauser lives in Durham, North Carolina with his wife and two children, where he teaches at North Carolina State University. He earned his MFA from the University of North Carolina-Greensboro.\n\n\u201cA riveting novel\u2026 far, far funnier than it has any right to be,\u201d adds Brock Clarke, author of The Happiest People in the World. \u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of Charles Portis and Denis Johnson\u2026 then this book is exactly what you\u2019ve been wanting, what you\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: Viki Redding", "name": "Travis Mulhauser", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-02-09T19:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/981751345241945/"}, {"description": "ENGAGE AND BE HEARD.\nSHARE YOUR WORK.\nCONNECT WITH OTHERS.\n\nArtsX UMMA is a gathering of students to bring different groups together on campus who are interested in leadership, diversity, and the arts.

Just as she did in her award-winning novel Between Shades of Gray, Ruta unearths a shockingly little-known casualty of a gruesome war, and proves that humanity can prevail, even in the darkest of hours.\n\nIt's 1945 in East Prussia. World War II is drawing to a close as Russian forces overtake the Germans, and thousands of refugees are on a frantic trek toward freedom, almost all of them with something to hide. Among the throngs of people seeking safety are Joana, Emilia, and Florian: each one borne of a different homeland, yet equally desperate to escape a life marked by brutality and war. As their paths converge en route to the Wilhelm Gustloff--the former cruise ship that promises each character's salvation and future just beyond the Baltic Sea--the three are forced by circumstance to unite, and with each step closer toward safety, their strength, courage, and trust in each other are tested. Yet just when it seems freedom is within their grasp, Russian torpedoes strike the massive ship. Not country, nor culture, nor status matter as all ten thousand people aboard must fight for the same thing: survival. Most will not make it.\n\n\u201cWith exquisite prose, Sepetys plumbs the depths of her quartet of characters, bringing each to the breaking point and back, shaping a narrative that is as much about the intricacies of human nature as it is about a historical catastrophe. Nominated for both the Morris Award and the Carnegie Medal for her first novel, Between Shades of Gray (2011), Sepetys returns to those roots with another harrowing, impeccably researched story of hardship and survival in Eastern Europe\u2026This haunting gem of a novel begs to be remembered, and in turn, it tries to remember the thousands of real people its fictional characters represent.\u201d\u2014Booklist, starred review\n\n\u201cSepetys delivers another knockout historical novel\u2026Sepetys excels in shining light on lost chapters of history, and this visceral novel proves a memorable testament to strength and resilience in the face of war and cruelty.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly, starred review\n\n\u201cWith the same lyrical prose, eye for detail, and breath-stopping ability to unfold delicate layers of characterization and theme with skillfully paced revelations, the author of Between Shades of Gray (2011) and Out of the Easy (2013) presents a fictionalized World War II story based on a true tragedy\u2026Observations of war and loss, human cruelty, and hatred, are unflinching. But through the horror and heartbreak shine rays of hope: love, kindness, courage, and sacrifice. Verdict: Artfully told and sensitively crafted, Sepetys\u2019 s exploration of this little-known piece of history will leave readers weeping.\u201d \u2014School Library Journal, starred review\n\nRuta Sepetys (www.rutasepetys.com) was born and raised in Michigan in a family of artists, readers, and music lovers.

That\u2019s the sound I\u2019m going for.\u201d The result is music that is just as easily enjoyed blowing down the highway or simply lying next to someone you love. It\u2019s music that you feel. The band, a four-piece group comprised of guitarist/vocalist Robbie Cook (the extra \u2018e\u2019 was dropped by bookkeepers on Ellis Island), bassist Carl Limbacher, drummer Jacob Berg, and female backing vocalist Angie Atkinson. Their debut EP is anticipated spring of 2015 with an east coast/mid-west tour to follow. Cook, a twenty-nine year old blues guitarist hailing from Ann Arbor, Michigan, was a late bloomer to the music world. He picked up his first guitar at the age of eighteen and hasn\u2019t put it down since, bouncing from project to project until finally moving to NYC to pursue his dream full-time. He worked hard to define his musical style and was greatly inspired by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Dave Matthews Band, Ben Harper, and countless others before stumbling upon blues master Eric Clapton. \u201cThat,\u201d he says, \u201cis when my direction became clear.\u201d A spark was ignited and Cook now strives to emulate musical giants such as Stevie Ray Vaughn, Big Bill Broonzy, and Robert Johnson. With his band\u2019s debut EP right around the corner, writing has become the new daily routine. Cooke\u2019s strong catalog of blues licks, pop hooks, and delicious melodies creates a sound that is modern and exciting while still paying reverence to the classics. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Cook says, \u201cI want to write great songs. I want to bring fresh vitality to the Blues, a style that forever changed the course of my life and direction of my dreams. I\u2019m well on my way\u2014here\u2019s hoping I never stop trying.\u201d", "name": "Cooke w/ Cetan Clawson Revival & The Howling Loud 2/10/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-02-10T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1087790041253279/"}, {"description": "Join us Thursday evenings, from February 11 through March 3, for the mesmerizing music, humor, and sentiment of the one and only Jacques Brel.

The area surrounding Cashiers, North Carolina is home to people of all kinds, but the world that Jacob lives in is crueler than most. His father runs a methodically organized meth ring, with local authorities on the dime to turn a blind eye to his dealings. Having dropped out of high school, subsequently cutting himself off from his peers, Jacob has been working for this father for years, all on the promise that his payday will come eventually. The only joy he finds comes from reuniting with Maggie, his first love, and a girl clearly bound for bigger and better things than their hardscrabble town. The world that Jacob inhabits is bleak and unrelenting in its violence and disregard for human life, and having known nothing more, Jacob wonders if he can muster the strength to rise above it.\n\n\u201cRemarkable...

Readers turn through pages of darkness hoping that, against the odds, Jacob can find his way to the light.\u201d \u2014 Memphis Commercial-Appeal\n\n\u201c[A] gripping first novel...[a] tragic, absorbing plot.

February 19 | 9pm | 18+ | $12 adv./ $14 Day of\n\nMustard Plug with The Vulnerable [https://www.facebook.com/thevulnerable ] &  1592\n\nMustard Plug started out in the punk clubs, basements and dive bars of the Midwest, playing punk-influenced ska music before most people in the U.S. had ever heard of ska. They clung to a DIY work ethic that had been ingrained in them growing up in the 1980\u2032s hardcore punk scene and applied it to everything they would ever do together as a band. Mustard Plug released their first cassette tape themselves (1992\u2032s Skapocalypse Now!), and played constantly to earn enough money to record their first album \u2013 1994\u2032s Big Daddy Mulititude. Their debut full length was released on legendary NYC label Moon Records (home of Toasters, Hepcat, Dance Hall Crashers, and pretty much every other 90\u2032s ska band of note). With their new found national distribution and exposure, the band climbed into their van and performed their music to new fans across North America. Twenty-one years, 1500 shows and 200,000 album sales later, it cannot be denied that the band has surpassed all expectations and permanently staked their claim in contemporary music.\n\nFor their new album, \u201cCan\u2019t Contain It\u201d, Mustard Plug have returned to the DIY blueprint that the band was built upon, while at the same time embracing all the school of hard knocks craftsmanship and wisdom that the band has earned along the way. The band spent the last several years writing new material that was informed by 22 years of songwriting experience while retaining the youthful energy that has endeared them to their fans. They tracked the record at bassist Rick Johnson\u2019s Cold War Studios, giving them the flexibility to experiment and add new layers and dimensions that were not possible given the time constraints on their previous recordings. Many of their musician friends(Dan Potthast, Sean Bonnett, Mark Petz, Corey Ruffin) were tapped to contribute, creating a denser, more intricate sound.\n\nOnce the recording process for Can\u2019t Contain It was complete, the band turned to their fans to help finance the mixing and production of their record. Their Kickstarter campaign surpassed all their expectations, doubling their initial goal and re-confirming the support and love of their audience. The tracks were then sent to be mixed at Bill Stevenson\u2019s Blasting Room Studios where Mustard Plug had recorded 3 of their previous albums (including 1997\u2019s breakthrough \u201cEvildoers Beware\u201d and 2007\u2019s \u201cIn Black and White\u201d). The result is possibly their most diverse and best record to date.\n\nAfter tapping their friends and fans to help out with the recording, the band turned to more of their posse to collaborate on the artwork. Underground icon Jeff Rosenstock designed the album packaging, while noted artists Craig Horkey and Larry Kole created alternative limited edition album covers and posters. The final piece came together when at the last minute, No Idea record founder, Var Thelin heard the record and offered to partner with the band on its release. Mustard Plug is excited to be given the opportunity to collaborate with a label known for its\u2019 strong punk rock ethics and underground credibility.\n\nUltimately, this release is about the community Mustard Plug has built during its\u2019 22 year existence. Coming full circle back to the DIY scene and the community that the were born out of has helped them to put out their best record to date.", "name": "Mustard Plug, The Vulnerable & 1592 2/19/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-02-19T21:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/510894402424469/"}, {"description": "Tell your friends!

March 5 | 9pm | $15 Cover | 18+\n\nElectric Six -  Mortality. It\u2019s the primary reason we don\u2019t live forever. If not for our mortality, the number of years each of us would have to roam this earth would be as infinite as the sands of time running through the earth itself. When extraterrestrials eventually make first contact with us within the next twenty years, the first glaringly obvious thing they will notice\u2026is that we die. They will come to our planet with sinister intentions and they will immediately have the upper hand because we die\u2026and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a simple as that. And it\u2019s all because of our mortality.\n\nWhile aliens (and the government!!!!!) will always be there to kill us, we have for generations used our cold dead hands to clutch onto whatever silver lining we could sew into the dark cloud of our everlasting mortality. Specifically, we tell ourselves that we can live forever, not in corporeal form, but through our creations of art\u2026and our expressions of love.\n\nThusly, art and love are more important than ever, because they are now the conduits that preserve our life forces. If you don\u2019t create art and you don\u2019t love nobody\u2026well then, you will be forgotten, rather quickly. No one wants to be forgotten rather quickly. No one more so\u2026than Electric Six.\n\nElectric Six understands all this stuff as it prepares to unveil its eleventh studio album Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, which will be released on October 6 on Metropolis Records. The album is steeped in themes of mortality, death, discorporation and discoloration\u2026all while it tries to convince you it is actually a work of art, a labour of love.\n\nFrom the pounding, driving opener, \u201cDrone Strikes\u201d, through the 1970s guitar anthem \u201cTwo Dollar Two\u201d, Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die! reveals that Electric Six knows that it is going to die, but will not go out quietly. From there, the album moves through the pop goodness of \u201cKids Are Evil\u201d and \u201cA Variation of Elaine\u201d, the prog-rock showmanship of \u201cSlow Motion Man\u201d, and even a tribute to Elvis Presley in his more rotund years with \u201cDime Dime Penny Dime\u201d.\n\n\u201cBig Red Arthur\u201d is the anchor track of the album, as it emits a rock-opera bombast that is reminiscent of Radiohead sodomizing David Bowie in the center of his mind. It, like most of the songs on this record, is about death\u2026but it\u2019s kind of funny because it\u2019s only about the death of a fake, out-of-shape drunk Santa Claus who is too fucking stupid to make it down the chimney correctly. In this case, we just end up laughing at death. And that\u2019s uplifting.\n\nTo summarize, mortality is everywhere, and this fall, thanks to their new record Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, Electric Six will be everywhere too. Everybody gonna die someday, but with Electric Six\u2019s new album, you no longer have to worry about any of it. Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die is Electric Six\u2019s brand new record for 2015 and it is available on Metropolis Records on Oct. 2. You can come see Electric Six play in your town on the I Wanna Lick The Screen tour, starting in their home state of Michigan on Sept. 25.\n\nWSG: Parlour Tricks", "name": "Electric Six w/ Parlour Tricks 3/5/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-03-05T21:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/998925893483957/"}, {"description": "One day at a time, discover colorful Motor City moments in history spanning more than three centuries.

He has returned home to the Bay Area after living in Los Angeles these past three years, and is self-producing his new album with help from friends in Berkeley and San Francisco. The Zombie Dinosaur LP revisits the satirical, funny, uptempo style of Lars\u2019 2004 debut album, the Laptop EP. It features guest appearances by Watsky, Kool Keith, and Less than Jake\u2019s Roger Lima. Zombie Dinosaur tackles such topics as postfeminism, in a nod to Game of Thrones (\u201cDragon Blood\u201d); disappointing reunion bands with very few of their original members (\u201cSublime with Rome is Not the Same thing as Sublime\u201d); hipster parenting (\u201cHipster Mom\u201d); and the current state of EDM (\u201cSigning Dubstep\u201d). The project was funded entirely by Lars\u2019s third highly successful Kickstarter campaign, through which he raised over $42k to create and release Zombie Dinosaur under his own label, Horris Records. In the ten years that have followed his debut release, the Laptop EP, Lars has independently produced and released three other solo full-length albums, four EPs, and a number of mixtapes. He has collaborated with KRS-One, mentored and helped develop the career of fellow Stanford alum K.Flay (with whom he collaborated on the 2009 Single and Famous EP), opened for Nas and Snoop Dogg, and played multiple summers on the Vans Warped Tour. He has also headlined club shows across the US and in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Lars has spoken and presented at two different TEDx conferences, performed at Carnegie Hall with a live string section (at Scholastic\u2019s 2012 Art and Writing Awards \u2013 where he debuted the video for his song, \u201cFlow Like Poe,\u201d which is the lead single on his 2012 Edgar Allan Poe EP). Lars has developed and grown Horris Records in this past decade, signing the label\u2019s first artist, Weerd Science (the solo hip-hop project of Cohered & Cambria\u2019s drummer, Josh Eppard). Lars has continued to produce music videos for himself and his friends, including a cameo credit on past musical collaborator \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic\u2019s 2014 \u201cLame Claim to Fame\u201d (for which Lars was given a special shout out in the liner notes to Al\u2019s Grammy Award winning album, Mandatory Fun). Having been labeled as one of the pioneers of the underground \u201cnerdcore hip-hop\u201d subgenre, Lars has recently expanded from the studio to the classroom. With visiting scholar/teacher residencies at USC, and in the UK, and across the US in Nantucket, Florida, California, Alaska, and Kansas, Lars has found joy in educating young people about \u201clit-hop,\u201d a subject term he coined to highlight the connections between literature, classical poetry, and the cultural history of rap. Lars has continued to work closely with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, teaching workshops on preventing self-harm, and positive ways to use music as creative therapy for depression. He has also worked with the American Heart Association, promoting youth heart health. It\u2019s been quite a decade.

The loss of a life, a love, a job, a home, will shake our foundation and we will inevitably crumble.  We then consider ourselves defeated; disheartened and utterly broken. But there is power in the acknowledgment of brokenness.\n\nNever Not Broken is taken from the Hindu Goddess Akhilanda or the 'Always Broken Goddess'. \"Akhilanda derives her power from being broke: in flux, pulling herself apart, living in different selves [and states of being] at the same time, from never becoming a whole that has limitations.\" (*1)\n\n\"Fluid connections, the celebration of ambiguity and a sense of ritual in chaos... deeply invested in the notion of complexity, this work will explore the arena of [brokenness] as an entree to rapture.  Artists working in this mode push the deconstruction and dissolution of centre, definitions and boundaries to reach the sublime terror [and beauty] of placelessness [and brokenness]\" *(2)\n\nBrokenness is not indicative of weakness or inability, but rather can be a strong driving force towards creative output as a means of analysis, internalizing, and coping for many artists.  This show seeks work that was created from a state of, and acknowledges our, Never Not Brokenness.\n\n(*1) Excerpt from the online article Why Lying Broken in a Pile on Your Bedroom Floor is a Good Idea by Julie Peters, Elephant Journal\n\n(*2) Excerpt from the Essay Beneath the Remains by Shamin M.

It\u2019s a powerful introduction, enormous and overwhelming, as Zach Williams, Brian Elmquist, and Kanene Pipkin testify mightily to life\u2019s great struggles and joys, heralding the morning that dispels the dark night: \u201cThen came the morning! It was bright, like the light that you kept from your smile!\u201d Working with producer Aaron Dessner of the National, the Lone Bellow has created a sound that mixes folk sincerity, gospel fervor, even heavy metal thunder, but the heart of the band is harmony: three voices united in a lone bellow.\n\n\"The feeling I get singing with Zach and Brian is completely natural and wholly electrifying,\u201d says Kanene. \u201cOur voices feel like they were made to sing together.\"\n\nLong before they combined their voices, the three members of the Lone Bellow were singing on their own. Brian had been writing and recording as a solo artist for more than a decade, with three albums under his own name. Kanene and her husband Jason were living in Beijing, China, hosting open mic nights, playing at local clubs and teaching music lessons. Zach began writing songs in the wake of a family tragedy: After his wife was thrown from a horse, he spent days in the hospital at her bedside, bracing for the worst news. The journal he kept during this period would eventually become his first batch of songs as a solo artist. Happily, his wife made a full recovery.\n\nWhen Kanene\u2019s brother asked her and Zach to sing \u201cO Happy Day\u201d together at his wedding, they discovered their voices fit together beautifully, but starting a band together seemed impossible when they lived on opposite sides of the world. Brian soon relocated to New York and Kanene moved there to attend culinary school a couple years later. The three got together in their new hometown to work on a few songs of Zach\u2019s, he\u2019d been chipping away at the scene as a solo artist for awhile by then. After hitting those first harmonies did they decide to abandon all other pursuits. Soon the trio was playing all over the city, although they considered Rockwood Music Hall on the Lower East Side to be their home. They opened for the Civil Wars, Dwight Yokam, Brandi Carlile and the Avett Brothers, and their self-titled debut, produced by Nashville\u2019s Charlie Peacock (the Civil Wars, Holly Williams) and released in January 2013, established them as one of the boldest new acts in the Americana movement.\n\nAfter two hard years of constant touring, the band was exhausted but excited. By 2014, they had written nearly 40 songs on the road and were eager to get them down on tape. After putting together a list of dream producers, they reached out to their first choice, the National guitarist Aaron Dessner, who has helmed albums by the L.A. indie-rock group Local Natives and New York singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten.\n\n\u201cIt occurred to me that it would be fun to get together and make music with them,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cMy main interest in producing records is community and friendship more than making money. I already do a lot of traveling and working with the National, so when I have to time to work with other artists, it should be fun and meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAaron is just so kind,\u201d Zach says. \u201cAnd he has surrounded himself with all these incredibly talented people, like Jonathan Low, the engineer. His brother Bryce [Dessner, also a guitarist for the National] wrote these amazing brass and string arrangements, and he got some of his friends to play with us.\u201d\n\nDessner and the Lone Bellow spent two weeks recording at Dreamland in upstate New York, a nineteenth-century church that had been converted into a homey studio. The singers found the space to inspire the emotional gravity necessary for the material and the acoustics they were looking for. (For Kanene, Dreamland had one other bonus: \u201cI\u2019m a big Muppets fan, and it looks exactly like the church where Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem lived.\u201d)\n\nAaron set them up in a circle in what had once been the sanctuary, with microphones hanging in the rafters to capture the sound of their voices bleeding together. Most of the vocals were recorded in single takes, a tactic that adds urgency to songs like \u201cHeaven Don\u2019t Call Me Home\u201d and \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Love Me.\u201d \u201cThere were a couple of times when somebody sang the wrong word or hit a bad note, and we just had to keep going,\u201d says Zach, who says that recording \u201cMarietta\u201d in particular was daunting\u2014especially the moment near the end when he hits an anguished high note, bends it even higher, and holds it for an impossibly long time. It\u2019s a startling display of vocal range, but it\u2019s also almost unbearably raw in its emotional honesty.\n\n\u201c\u2018Marietta\u2019 is probably the darkest song on the whole record,\u201d Zach explains, \u201cand it\u2019s based on something that happened between my wife and me. The band was getting ready to record that song when all of a sudden my wife showed up with our youngest baby. It was a great surprise, a beautiful moment. So I was able to go out and sing that song, knowing she was there to help me carry the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are true stories,\u201d says Brian. \u201cThese aren\u2019t things we made up. We tried to write some songs that had nothing to do with our personal stories, but we just didn\u2019t respond to them. But we\u2019re best buds, so we know each others\u2019 personal stuff and trust each other to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it.\u201d Case in point: Brian wrote \u201cCall to War\u201d about his own struggles during his twenties, but gave the song to Kanene to sing. \u201cThe content is painful and brutal,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the imagery, the vocals, they build something delicate and ethereal. That kind of contrast illuminates the true beauty and power of a song.\u201d\n\nSays Brian, \u201cWe do this one thing together, and we carry each other. Hopefully that makes the listener want to be a part of it. It becomes a communal thing, which means that there\u2019s never a sad song to sing. It\u2019s more a celebration of the light and the dark.\u201d", "name": "The Lone Bellow 3/25/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-03-25T21:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1550469435268350/"}, {"description": "Saturday, March 26, 2016, 8:00 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\nBach\u2019s complete Sonatas and Partitas have long been a \u201cMount Everest\u201d of the violin repertoire \u2014 music that performers return to throughout their lives.

Their first full-length album, released in February, 2014, on Anticon and Big Dada has been given the kind of critical appraisal normally held hidden in the filing cabinets of dusty music journos and only brought out, along with the bottle of fine blended whisky for those special occasions, those special rock occasions. You know the kind, when a credible bunch of guitar, bass and drum twenty-somethings from some northern town in the UK or from Indianapolis USA put something together in the studio that reaches out and reminds everyone that modern life isn\u2019t rubbish. Which is a weird reaction for a group who sit in some non-categorisable space between genres ancient and modern, who take hiphop and pop and dip it in a tie-dye mix of Ronnettes and krautrock and ragga and dub and post-punk and afropsych\u2026 and make something, something, something.\n\nMany years before dropping DEAD the three individuals who became Young Fathers were apprentice young men. 14 years old, meeting in a sweaty dancing circle in the infamous original Bongo Club in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. Moving to the in-your-face beats of early noughties hiphop, R&B and Dancehall and then at the end of the night, agreeing to meet at solemn faced would-be producer G\u2019s house, to \u2018make records\u2019 on an ancient karaoke machine. The three of them, already looking like their future selves: Alloysious, city street holy man, sad eyes to the stars, past of the Liberian war atrocities buried in childhood scar tissue; Kayus, face exploding from frowns to huge laughter, pure naija boy on the outside but reflective and always feeling far away from his Nigerian home on the inside; and G, quietly watching and waiting for good things to come, practising the serious don\u2019t fuck street face for the neds where he grew up, but nurturing a heart of soul.\n\nFrom the bedroom to the basement. It took them a few years before they found the small underground studio in Leith where they could perfect the uniqueness already nascent in the early days. Here they developed what they call, like the Sicilian mafia, \u2018our thing\u2019. Recording processes that involve ritual, musical techniques more usually found in bebop jazz, playing with ways to write lyrics and tunes, scouring the further reaches and always recoiling from clich\u00e9. But always, always staying true to the Rules of Pop which demand hooks, energy, sparkle, accessibility, passion and beats that vibrate below the waist. From this point came their first release, what was originally conceived as a mixtape, literally only available on individually recorded cassettes with hand printed sleeves: TAPE ONE was the moment, recorded in a week, ready to release in two.\n\nShortly thereafter, TAPE TWO was recorded and a deal with far-out Los Angeles hiphopping label, Anticon inked. TAPE TWO took the dirty mounds of its predecessor and moulded beautiful sand sculptures, sealed by the sea, with the same processes, the same inspiration, gone deeper, gone darker. A year after its release TAPE TWO wins the Scottish Album Of The Year Award (2014), an indication, perhaps, that people are really starting to get it. YFs are just happy more people are listening, even if that 20 grand prize money does come in handy for debts and mashed up gear. And a final, critical tick from the music business comes at the end of summer when the album is nominated for a Mercury award.\n\nDid I mention the live show? I don\u2019t believe so\u2026 on an insane tour of the USA, UK and Europe, heading over to Australia, Japan, Russia and then back to Europe. A huge 27-date UK & European tour preceded standout performances at SXSW, with a 33-date US tour supporting Anticon\u2019s Baths before playing a homecoming show at the Park Stage at Glastonbury. By the end of this year, YFs will have driven around the world one and a half times and flown it several times more. What happens? Each time they appear as a support, the headliner regrets and celebrates, because, if the headliner can\u2019t hope to make the desired impact after the explosion of uber-watt energy that is a Young Fathers show, they can at least reflect and bask in the knowledge that they were partly responsible for something special happening.\n\nWhen they headline, they squeeze hours into 45 minutes and leave the audience exhausted from spectacle and bass, necks aching from craning, ears ringing and a delayed smile forming as they leave after pointless demands for more. (Of course, YFs never give more, because they have given all they have).\n\nSounds like hyperbole? Read the reviews\u2026 The Guardian were particularly kind about DEAD, Alexis Petridis wrote: \u201cYoung Fathers have quietly constructed a strange and intoxicating musical universe that feels entirely their own\u201d \u2013 Guardian 4/5 (Lead Review). I know the group intimately and yet they still shock me on a regular basis. Not with anything as base as the kind of look-at-me desperation of a shocking rocking Rocky Horror spit show, nor with pyro and cannons and strippers or any of the other circus tricks. Just with presence and passion and looking like that beamed in from another world lost aliens with a message of love type of group. With intense engagement\u2026 intense\u2026 the Johnny Rotten, Ian Curtis, James Brown kind. Taking that brief blast of special that is normally only allowed to boys from terraced houses for a couple of years before imp or exp-losion but YFs just, keep it going, impossibly, like an Ethiopian marathon racer. Which should be an indication, dear star watchers, that something special is happening.\n\nOK, 850 odd words and still so much info to impart. How about\u2026 America, it\u2019s like jumping into a deep fat fryer, so many delicious possibilities, like: Jimmy Kimmel, set to take the crown of late night TV chat show hosts, who hosted Young Fathers in June, watched by the entire Anticon roster, performing with blood shot intensity after 24 hours of partying (yes, they party, seriously of course, as you ask) in Los Angeles. More America: the entire staff of KEXP in Seattle, cramming into the control booth and watching in awe during YFs\u2019 radio session there. If you know how many artists go through those doors you\u2019ll know what an accolade that is.\n\nWhat about the BBC? How about all the love from Zane Lowe for the singles, not to mention the weekly shows they made for 1Xtra through October last year (2013) ? Episodes of some outer space Dada drama slotted in amongst all the herbal urban clich\u00e9s. How about being banned by the beeb? Queen Is Dead, from TAPE TWO, officially banned just in case the Queen of Britain pops her clogs at the moment of spinning.\n\nTime to round it up and leave all the untold good stuff for another time. Now signed with Big Dada, Young Fathers are already recording the next album, printing more of their iconic T-shirts (have you got one yet? You\u2019ll probably have to wait), making more videos, sweating their way through the summer festivals, ignoring stupid borders and other constraints in order to bring it, whatever it is, to you.

No other mariachi in history has had a trajectory or influence remotely comparable to theirs; they are widely considered the finest mariachi in the world.

Masters at melding the old world style of mariachi music with new, innovative pieces, Mariachi Vargas is appealing to audiences across all generations. \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/1516-mariachi-vargas-de-tecalitlan", "name": "Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-01T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/453190221522442/"}, {"description": "In a career that spans 23 albums and includes three Grammy awards, Tom Chapin has covered a lot of creative ground. In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse. www.tomchapin.com", "name": "Tom Chapin at  Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-01T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1713063788906616/"}, {"description": "March 31 - April 3\nDetroit Opera House\n\nUMS and Michigan Opera Theatre join forces to bring American Ballet Theatre\u2019s new production of The Sleeping Beauty to the Detroit Opera House.

And now, with their second full-length album Drinking From A Salt Pond, Run River North are poised to push forward and create their own wake as a major voice in today\u2019s music landscape.\n\nSince the band\u2019s beginnings just over four years ago, their rise has been steadily spectacular, marked by appearances on national television, sold-out shows at historic venues, tours with rock and roll royalty and heaps of praise from fans and critics alike. As they blossomed, they embraced their initially folk-driven sound, which found its harmonic home alongside rootsy, foot stomping, sing-along-leading peers like Mumford & Sons, The Head and the Heart, and Of Monsters and Men. Powered by the acoustic-guitar-and-vocals songwriting of frontman Alex Hwang, their 2014 self-titled debut record, produced by Phil Ek (Fleet Foxes, Modest Mouse, Band of Horses), was released with their lineup rounded out by the strings duo of Daniel Chae and Jennifer Rim, Joe Chun on bass, Sally Kang on keys, and John Chong on drums.\n\nAs time and tours passed, the six lives spent in close-quarters began to grind the gears a little differently; their whole dynamic began to change. \u201cWhen we became a band, we mostly played Alex\u2019s songs in band form,\u201d says Chae. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve all put our musical input into it, so the music has changed a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were tired of me on acoustic guitar and everybody singing harmonies,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe were hitting a ceiling, and it wasn\u2019t fun. We had always agreed this band was six-ways, for better or worse. So at the end of last year, after being in the van constantly, we said, \u2018no more touring, let\u2019s write new songs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to grow up pretty fast as a band,\u201d says Chong. \u201cSo this past year, there were times when different perspectives and priorities have butted heads.\u201d\n\nDuring the writing of Drinking From A Salt Pond, the band admits to flaring tempers and tense operations as they worked to redefine their sound, goals and relationships. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of hating each other, almost kicking people out of the band,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe\u2019re being honest and that openness is one of the main thrusts for the album. Embracing the bitter with the sweet, not trying to hide the crappy parts\u2026the crappy parts helped make the good.\u201d Being open about its faults, the band recognizes how the turmoil has helped Run River North create something beautiful.\n\n\u201cThe record we just made, it\u2019s all the difficult stuff we went through so there\u2019s a darker tone to the music. It works,\u201d says Chae.\n\nOne of the first steps in leaving behind their folk roots was to work with new collaborators. Instead of the reverb-heavy, northwest sound of Ek, they recorded in Los Angeles with Lars Stalfors (Cold War Kids, HEALTH, Deap Vally, Matt and Kim) at the production helm. Stalfors opened their eyes to the upbeat energy and electric tone of indie bands like The Walkmen. Throughout Salt Pond the indie rock influence can be heard, with the band nodding inspiration to everyone from Cage the Elephant and Kings of Leon to The National, Death Cab for Cutie, and Cold War Kids, whose studio in San Pedro, CA the band borrowed to make the album. Also, in a move encouraged by their record label, Nettwerk, Hwang and Chae were sent to Nashville for a week in April 2015 to work on a few new tracks with two different co-writers, Lincoln Parish (formerly of Cage the Elephant) and the Kings of Leon collaborator Nick Brown.\n\n\u201cIt was weird but at the same time it was really encouraging,\u201d says Hwang of the co-writing. \u201cIt was like bringing our demos to a blind date.\u201d\n\nThe first song from the Nashville sessions was \u201cRun Or Hide,\u201d co-written with Parish, and from first listen it\u2019s clear that Run River North are exploring bombastic new territory. Hwang, Chae, and Parish came up with an organic way of working that was based on jamming and vibing together, and once the song\u2019s melody was nailed down, the rest came easily. It was immediately hard-hitting than any previous song from the band, with a discernible strut serving as a sonic contrast. When the demo was sent home to LA, the rest of the band was shocked.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone else was really scared,\u201d says Hwang, \u201c\u2018this is not your voice, this is not who we are.\u2019 I was confident it was a really good song and that we were gonna keep it. There\u2019s nothing more aggressive on the record, and that groove on the verses is bigger than the band. The band can\u2019t contain the song.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved it!\u201d says Chong emphatically. \u201cAlex has a very wide range of emotion when he sings\u2014soft, whispery things; really bombastic; rough\u2014this song showcases all of that. I got really excited. When we recorded it, it really showcases more groove. Joe, our bass player, is solid, and the way the melody is created in the verses really adds to that. There\u2019s a really cool contrast happening, but the choruses hit hard.\u201d\n\nThe other song written in Tennessee was the Nick Brown co-penned \u201cCan\u2019t Come Down,\u201d a track with pop qualities that the band does not shy away from recognizing. For that they leaned on Brown heavily, who served almost as a mentor to Hwang and Chae during the sessions, teaching them about pop hooks, authenticity, and Southern tradition. Deciding to go all in on a pop song, the trio rallied behind Brown\u2019s catchy melodies and licks, and what they ended up with is a happy medium that \u201cstill sounds as Run River North as possible,\u201d according to Chong, while simultaneously reaching for the rafters.\n\n\u201cWe really gelled with Nick Brown,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe had the same idea: \u2018We have enough songs that exemplify us, so let\u2019s try our hand at writing a pop hook.\u2019 With that mentality we came up with \u2018Can\u2019t Come Down.\u2019 Nick wrote the hook, Daniel and Nick wrote the music, and a heavy collaboration on lyrics from everyone. It\u2019s the first song I ever sang the word \u2018baby\u2019 in.\u201d\n\nWith those songs firmly planting the band\u2019s flag in new ground, it is Hwang\u2019s \u201c29\u201d that may be the best indicator of the band Run River North are becoming. A piano and drum fueled anthem examining the ups and downs of transition, it finds the singer posing multiple existential questions at once. \u201cEveryone\u2019s always talking about how if you will something, it\u2019s gonna happen. But, sometimes it doesn\u2019t!\u201d says Hwang. \u201cThat was a realization I wanted to play with: \u2018Your words are cold like the wind\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s kind of like saying, \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think,\u2019 but it\u2019s also a reflection about my words. What I do can be just as insignificant as anyone else. So what are you gonna do about it? You\u2019re 29. \u2018I know it\u2019s home, I know it hurts/I know I\u2019ll end up at the bottom/What if I leave?\u2019 What if we go on this tour and we don\u2019t end up anywhere? The brutal question is, who cares, and why does it matter? Not answering that in the song really helps. The music is still upbeat, it still has the \u2018oh\u2019s\u2019 going on, it\u2019s an anthemic thing. I\u2019m still energetic, I\u2019m not some old dude at 29.\u201d\n\n\u201c29\u201d was written on electric guitar, a tool Hwang has been using more frequently since the end of the debut album\u2019s touring cycle. Originally intended for a more somber feel, at the suggestion of their producer Stalfors, the tempo rose to meet Hwang\u2019s intonations. \u201cIt became this song with so much energy,\u201d says Chong, \u201cit\u2019s probably the fastest song we\u2019ve ever done as a band. It\u2019s new territory for us; it\u2019s very fun. It\u2019s a good transition, with lulled verses and really upbeat instrumentals and choruses. This is a good appetizer for our old fans, as this is who we\u2019ve become.\u201d\n\nEmbracing their natural growth and learning to ride the waves of their personal and musical evolutions with open hearts and nimble hands, Run River North have created a sophomore album that will propel them to the forefront of today\u2019s landscape. Although at times the rushing water of their rise will pool into depths tough to swallow, they have learned to lean on each other and to trust themselves along the way in order to make something lasting and truly beautiful.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, we always said we wanted to play on the biggest stages possible,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cThat\u2019s still the same. But it isn\u2019t some self-indulgent dream of becoming rock stars; we still want to support our families with this, we still have the parents that sacrificed for us and we want to honor them. For us as a band, at times it\u2019s felt like we\u2019ve been drinking from a salt pond\u2014and yet, we still created something pretty fresh that we like and are proud of.\u201d\n\nWSG: The Lighthouse and the Whaler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/634", "name": "Run River North w/ The Lighthouse & The Whaler 4/5/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-05T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/629378653882823/"}, {"description": "March 31 - April 3\nDetroit Opera House\n\nUMS and Michigan Opera Theatre join forces to bring American Ballet Theatre\u2019s new production of The Sleeping Beauty to the Detroit Opera House.

So we decided to just do it quick and dirty, old-school style. Like the open mic nights I used to play: unamplified guitar and vocals, friends with their axes playing along, arrangements arrived at on the fly and infinitely flexible. Four songs later we felt really inspired\u2014me and Matt played a song or two without anybody else around because we\u2019d gotten down to the basement before the others, the total song choice was strictly \u201cwhat do you figure we should play now?\u201d, the mood was relaxed and free\u2026we loved it. Later that night, we decided to strip down the drum kit to essentials and play a choke-the-motor set echoing and elaborating on what we\u2019d done downstairs: a sort of small-ensemble feel, lower in volume but actually higher in intensity. Like what we do in concentrate. It was one of our two favorite performances of the year, the other being the second night at the Fillmore. It felt like acres of new terrain opening up atop an ancient foundation. As soon as it was over, we all wanted to do it again. So in 2016 we\u2019re taking that set on the road. Not that exact set, obviously; the particulars will vary from night to night. But smaller rooms, audible frequencies, up close and personal: this is the general plan. Making eye contact with people in the back row, being able to go off-mic when I want to and still be heard. Total visibility. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this tour. I love the big album release shows as much as anybody, but that City Winery feel of just playing together with bare essentials in close quarters\u2026there\u2019s nothing like it, and when the whole room locks onto the signal, it\u2019s really special.\nWith: William Tyler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/581", "name": "The Mountain Goats w/ William Tyler 4/8/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-08T21:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/554988117991170/"}, {"description": "FREE\n\nDrop in to just one session, or attend them all.

Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Backin the Ring. Chris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet,Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, TheLumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records. Chris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases.In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist. Her latest album, Backin the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimedHow I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons. \u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms.For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards. \n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/595", "name": "Chris Pureka 4/28/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-28T21:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1318721681600135/"}, {"description": "Michigan's cult hero of comedy", "name": "Heywood Banks", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/480751802102134/"}, {"description": "Don Campbell is a contemporary/country crossover and folk-rock singer/songwriter whose presentation of music supports the story in the song and welcomes the audience on board for the ride.

The band consists of Jeanne Mackey, Tom Voiles, Linda Teaman, and Laz Slomovits. The name Harmony Bones comes from an acupuncture point that harmonizes imbalances and promotes clear thinking, seeing, and hearing.\nJeanne, Tom, Linda and Laz have joined forces to explore a wide range of traditional, contemporary and original folk songs. Rich vocal harmonies and an array of instruments -- guitar, mandolin, flute, pennywhistle, fiddle, banjo, percussion, sitar -- combine to make Harmony Bones.\nSinger/songwriter Jeanne Mackey offers a blend of emotional intensity, wry humor, and global consciousness. In addition to original tunes, her repertoire ranges from Dar Williams to Patsy Cline, from Pete Seeger to Irving Berlin. A seasoned guitarist, she draws on a variety of styles -- folk, classic swing, funky blues, and more -- with the occasional sprinkle of mandolin, accordion, or banjo. Mackey rocked the 1970s East Coast topical music circuit as a young musician advocating feminist values and social justice.  In 2010, Mackey created \"Drop The Knife: A Memoir-in-Song,\" an evening of original songs and stories exploring the meaning of homeland, curses, death, and magic.\nLinda Teaman and Tom Voiles do much of their singing and playing with Nutshell, an Ann Arbor-based Celtic roots band. Nutshell plays for contra-dances and performs at festivals across North America.\nLinda is a singer who brings depth of understanding, warmth and sensitivity to the music. In 2005, her graduation recital for a degree in k-12 choral music had her singing in five languages, encompassing musical forms such as Irish sean nos singing and Italian and German arias by composers Purcell, Mozart and Brahms. She leads the Rudolf Steiner Community Singers, a small choir that sings uncommon Christmas and seasonal songs of celebration.  She hopes you'll forgive her classical background and that she is redeemed by her love of folk music.  In addition to vocals, she adds light percussion to the mix.\nTom consumes a well-rounded musical diet that ranges from Celtic to Indian to rock and roll. He enjoys mixing different styles while maintaining a respect for the traditions from which they spring. Tom has studied North Indian Classical music, Moroccan folk drumming and western classical flute. He has worked with performance artists, dancers, mimes and poets, including Hosain Mosavat, Gerry the Fool, Matthew Smith, ML Liebler and the Magic Poetry Band.\nLaz Slomovits is one of the twin brothers in Ann Arbor\u2019s nationally-known children\u2019s music duo, Gemini. A fine singer and multi-instrumentalist, Laz is starting his 4nd year playing music. His songs are featured in songbooks used by music teachers throughout the country, and Gemini's recordings have won numerous awards. In addition, Laz has had a notable solo career. In his solo work, Laz is best known for his powerful musical settings of the poetry of ancient Sufi mystics Rumi and Hafiz, as well as that of contemporary American poets.", "name": "Harmony Bones at Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-13T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1637106023218709/"}, {"description": "The ears and eyes of America!", "name": "The Corn Potato String Band", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-15T19:30:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1080836985282330/"}, {"description": "Grammy winner Pat Donahue is one of the most popular finger pickers in the world.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-07T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/964923176923370/"}, {"description": "lauriemcclain.com", "name": "Laurie McLain at Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197527007266742/"}, {"description": "There is no better storyteller than Chuck Brodsky.  Ranging from poignant to hilarious, his songs are about the little things in the lives of everyday people.  Chuck's soulful and compassionate voice brings his characters to life, and is the perfect instrument for infusing his lyrics with heartfelt humanity or biting wit. His spoken introductions to his songs can be as spellbinding as his colorful lyrics, which he brings to life with a well-travelled voice and a delivery that's natural and conversational. His groove-oriented strumming and fingerpicking draw on influences from the mountains of western North Carolina where he now lives, and from lots of different good old traditional folk stuff of all kinds. Chuck is widely known for his many wonderful songs about the heroes -- and zeroes -- of baseball. His latest CD is The Baseball Ballads 2.\nwww.chuckbrodsky.com", "name": "Chuck Brodsky at Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-28T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/147078752335941/"}, {"description": "http://www.donhenry.com/", "name": "Don Henry at Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513216465641630/"}]
