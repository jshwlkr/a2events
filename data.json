Although he performed throughout high school and college as a classical and rock pianist, he chose to major in English Literature in college, and is an avid student of history.

Nov. 13 | 9pm | 18+ | $25 adv./ $30 day of\n\nVanessa Carlton\nwith: Joshua Hyslop\n\nAn unusual light shines through Liberman, Vanessa Carlton\u2019s fifth album. Its ten songs, built on ethereal melodies and lush orchestration, seem to climb out of the shadows, each resonating with a sense of haunting positivity.  The opening track, \u201cTake It Easy,\u201d instantly sets the tone, inviting the listener into a sort of sonic euphoria: each note and lyric thereafter builds on that aesthetic, creating an ongoing narrative that unfurls over its classic side A and side B. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a calm record,\u201d Carlton says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want any angst in there. I thought, \u2018What would I want to hear back? What would make me feel better in my darker times?\u2019 Even a phrase like \u2018take it easy,\u2019 which is in a million songs, brings happiness. This album leans toward seeing the good in humans and in the world.\u201d  \n\nCarlton began writing in the summer of 2012, beginning with \u201cUnlock The Lock,\u201d an evocative piano-driven track that set the tone for the songs to come. She\u2019d recently finished touring 2011\u2019s Rabbits On The Run, an album conceived through inspiration from Stephen Hawking\u2019s A Brief History of Time and Richard Adam\u2019s Watership Down. Carlton found herself in the desert and the song emerged, reflecting a newly revealing songwriting sensibility for the artist. \u201cI imagined a group of people listening to it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the first time I ever wanted to make something like s\u00e9ance music \u2013 something that would make a human brain feel at ease, something that would feel right in an everyday ritual. I also realized I wanted the record to be really soothing lyrically and not so much a reveal of me.\u201d\n\nThe musician followed that thread as she continued writing for the next year and a half, this time inspired by books like Joseph Campbell\u2019s The Power of Myth and Aldous Huxley\u2019s The Doors of Perception. Carlton\u2019s primary influence, however, was a colorful oil painting by her grandfather Alan J. Lee, who was originally named Liberman. The painting, created in 1963, hangs in Carlton\u2019s home and showcases three woman captured in swirling pastel colors. She wrote many songs while looking at the image, eventually deciding to call the album after her grandfather. \n\n\u201cThe swirly colors of that painting reminded me of the music and the music reminds me of those colors\u201d Carlton notes. \u201cThen I looked up what Liberman means and it\u2019s \u2018honorable man\u2019 and \u2018my beloved\u2019 \u2013 all these things that just felt right to me. It\u2019s a strong family name that, in a weird way, describes the music to me.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2013, Carlton gathered her songs and decamped to Real World Studio in Box, England to work with producer Steve Osborne, who\u2019d helmed Rabbits On The Run. In the studio, Carlton and Osborne focused on the sound, on creating layers of instrumentation with classic gear that veer away from crisp pop production and reference artists like Air. For Carlton, who began her career with several albums at the mercy of prescribed aesthetics, emphasizing the art of space and sonic beauty felt like the next step. This shift is revealed particularly in the trippy ambience of \u201cHouse of Seven Swords\u201d and the moody \u201cAscension,\u201d which builds a soundscape outward from the piano at its center. \n\nCarlton rounded out the album in Nashville, the city she now calls home, with producer Adam Landry who worked on three tracks. Carlton\u2019s husband, Deer Tick front man John McCauley, played on several songs throughout the process, including \u201cTake it Easy,\u201d \"Ascension\" and \u201cMatter of Time.\u201d The latter is stripped of instrumentation and highlights Carlton\u2019s voice as it soars over McCauley\u2019s delicately plucked electric guitar, reminiscent of the old school vocal recordings of Dusty Springfield.  As a whole, Liberman feels like a new chapter in Carlton\u2019s storied career, revealing new facets of her musical skill and instigating fresh inspirations. Stagnancy, she knows, is the antithesis to creativity. \n\n\u201cMartin Scorsese said sometimes your greatest challenge is not your failure but your success,\u201d Carlton says. \u201cIn a way I was able to persevere after having a success out of the gate and figure out a path that feels really pure to me. But I had to create this environment where I felt comfortable changing. When I was first doing records I was so young and I wanted to please everyone. But now I sort of feel ancient and I love it and I just want to make art for its own sake. Whether I fall on my face or not at least I know I did it. Everything I\u2019ve done and everything I am is there in the songs.\u201d", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1651671698445679/", "name": "Vanessa Carlton 11/13/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2015-11-14T11:00:00-05:00", "description": "Irving Stenn, Jr. Family Gallery\nMultipurpose Room\nFrom 11-1pm OR 2-4pm\n\nThis program is free and open to the public, but space is limited.

The book is an inquiry into animals of the world, their astonishing diversity and abundance; their mating habits, defensive strategies, and other behaviors; their extraordinary senses of sight, hearing, and smell. It is also an exploration of our profound connection with them, from the joys they inspire and the fears they arouse, to their prominence in our lives as pets, team mascots, and embodiments of wild nature-and the paradox that allows us to battle to protect certain species while ignoring others that are disappearing at a rate perhaps unequaled in the history of our planet.\n\nJerry Dennis' essays on nature have appeared in The New York Times, Smithsonian, Audubon, Orion, and many other publications. His books, most of them illustrated by Glenn Wolff, have received wide acclaim, have been translated into five languages, and have won numerous awards. He lives in northern Michigan.\n\nGlenn Wolff grew up in northern Michigan but he began his career in New York City as an illustrator for The New York Times, Village Voice, the Central Park Conservancy, and the New York Zoological Society. In addition to his collaborations with Jerry Dennis, he has illustrated a broad range of subjects, including food, Christmas, mythical beasts, and lost continents.

Word\u00b2 pairs one esteemed University professor with Sweetland faculty member for a conversation about writing.\n\nThis session features a conversation with Bruce Conforth. Growing up in New York City during the folk revival of the 1960s exposed Bruce to the culture and history of American Roots music at an early age. While still in his early teens he learned guitar from such legends as Reverend Gary Davis, Son House, Mississippi John Hurt, Skip James, and many others. In the 1970s he played with musical great Dave Van Ronk, performed at folk festivals across the country and at such celebrated clubs as New York\u2019s The Bitter End and Gerdes Folk City. His albums of blues and folksongs- \u201cCap\u2019n You\u2019re So Mean\u201d (Rounder Records) and \u201cNobody Knows My Name\u201d (Heritage Records) - were respectively voted as one of the best folk music recordings by the Library of Congress, and the year\u2019s best release by the Village Voice. \n\nBruce received his doctorate in ethnomusicology, folklore, and American Studies from Indiana University specializing in American traditional music. In 1991 he was appointed the founding curator of Cleveland\u2019s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Since leaving that post he has devoted his time to continuing his research in American Roots music, especially the country blues, establishing himself as one of the foremost experts on the life and music of blues great Robert Johnson. He has published extensively, given numerous conference papers, lectures, and keynote addresses, and has appeared on radio and television stations across the globe. His most recent book is African-American Folksong and American Cultural Politics (Scarecrow Press \u2013 2013) and he is completing, with co-author Gayle Dean Wardlow, the definitive biography of Robert Johnson. He is a faculty member of the University of Michigan\u2019s Program in American Culture where he teaches courses in the blues, folk music, folk culture, and tries to keep alive the memory and traditions of those great musicians who so graciously shared their talents and culture with him. He is a member of the Executive Board of the Robert Johnson Blues Foundation and a Director of the Blues Heritage Foundation.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/417940335074007/", "name": "Bruce Conforth", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2015-11-17T19:00:00-05:00", "description": "Written in narrow sections that blur the distinction between flash fiction and prose poetry, between memoir and meditation, \"Monograph\" veers from the elliptical to the explosive as it dissects the Gordian knot of a marriage's intellectual, sexual, and domestic lives.

Bringing together like\u00adminded players and friends, he and his able\u00adminded Freaks crafted two separate albums of material, a low\u00adkey self\u00adtitled release in 2009 and a more full\u00adbodied 2013 record entitled How Far Away.\n\nAlex Bleeker and the Freaks\u2019 third album Country Agenda is the culmination of Bleeker\u2019s songwriting, as well as the gelling together of a fully formed band. With the full\u00adtime inclusion of guitarist Alex Steinberg, bassist Nick Lenchner, drummer Dylan Shumaker and keyboardist Jacob Wolf, along with occasional guest vocals from Mountain Man singer Molly Sarle, The Freaks\u2019 vibe has coalesced considerably.\n\nNo longer the work of a single director, this version of the band gives the songs more room to breathe, allowing the tunes to move in unexpected directions. A wholly collaborative effort, Country Agenda features multiple songwriters and ensemble playing that stretches out in unhurried passages of glowing musical interplay. The songs wander in slow motion like a coastline drive, drawing on the same wizened energy and brilliant restraint as Crazy Horse, the Dead, Moby Grape and other like\u00adminded cosmic travelers. Easily the most realized and best sounding set of tunes from the project, the strengths of the album are magnified by a cohesive feeling that was absent on previous Freaks records. The sound here is undeniably the birth of a solid band playing together, locked in the groove, and moving down the road in unison.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/502", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/820090691422005/", "name": "Alex Bleeker & The Freaks 11/18/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2015-11-19T17:10:00-05:00", "description": "Michigan Theater\n603 E Liberty St\nAnn Arbor, MI 48104\nPrem Krishnamurthy is a founding principal of the award-winning design studio Project Projects and the director/curator of the critically-acclaimed multidisciplinary exhibition space P!.

Sure our phones are smart now, but let\u2019s consider the value of making other electronic devices intelligent enough to sense and transmit useful information - such as getting a heads up from your fridge before you\u2019ve poured recently-spoiled milk over your cereal. We\u2019ll review the sweeter side of presidential history with a project that re-interprets U.S. presidents as cupcakes, a lens through which even the worst policy decisions can become into melt-in-your-mouth magic. And finally, we\u2019ll think about using social media to encourage voters to get to the polls, instead of as a method of sharing cat videos - and with the November election just behind us, we\u2019ll even get to hear about how well it works!

The next technological revolution will be turning every appliance we use into a smart device. To create these devices, we need tiny sensors to allow the electronics to interact with the environment. Today these sensors are too large or too expensive, but luckily, engineers are working to reduce this sensor size and cost with the help of nano-electronics.\n\nAbout Matt: Matt is a doctorate student at the University of Michigan. For the past few years, he has worked heavily with semiconductor nanostructures in efforts to improve the future of solar and indoor lighting technologies. In his free time he enjoys hiking with his dog, music, and movies/television.\n\nSherlonya Turner - 35 Offbeat Ways of Looking at the POTUS\nSometimes the President of the United States seems larger than life. This humorous talk will bring them down to size with anecdotes that present them as more man than myth. The Head of State Cakes project, in which a cake recipe is created in honor of each president, is what happens when you cross a lifelong interest in presidential history with a love of baking. The results are not only tasty, they\u2019re pretty fun to talk about.\n\nAbout Sherlonya: Sherlonya has an all-consuming and perhaps overwhelming love for the presidents. She's interested in them less as politicians and more as men. Her history degree helps her put things in context. Her library degree gives her research tips and tricks. Her love of cooking has inspired her to create a tribute cupcake for each US President; see them all at headofstatecakes.com.

And their new album So Deliciouselevates the trio\u2019s work to a new level. Produced by Rev. Peyton, So Delicious offers the band\u2019s most diverse collection of songs buoyed by the Rev.\u2019s supercharged six-string virtuosity \u2014 a unique style of fingerpicking inspired by his Delta blues heroes, but taken to new, original heights.\n\nThe fifth full-length original album by the group \u2014 which includes Breezy Peyton on washboard and supporting vocals and Ben Bussell on drums and supporting vocals \u2014 is their debut on Yazoo Records, a label known for the historic reissues of blues and other old time American music that are the bedrock inspiration for the Rev.\u2019s sound and approach.\n\n\u201cYazoo was my favorite record label growing up,\u201d he explains. \u201cFor fans of old country blues and all manner of early American music, they are the quintessential label. And for me, it\u2019s like being on the same label as Charley Patton and \u2018Mississippi\u2019 John Hurt. To think that Yazoo believes we are authentic enough to stand with the other people in their catalog means a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band has always been strong on authenticity, playing music that blends blues, ragtime, folk, country and other traditional styles with the sleek modern energy of do-it-yourself, homespun, punk fueled rock. And performing tunes plucked from their lives, their community or from the canonical songbook that fed the Rev. Peyton\u2019s formative creative identity. It\u2019s a mix that\u2019s allowed the band to win fans from all corners of the Americana and rock worlds, and bring a new generation to blues and other forms of American roots music.\n\nSo Delicious is a perfect Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band album, with songs that speak from the heart and capture the trio \u2014 whose sound has been honed over 250 annual tour dates during the last eight years \u2014 playing at their peak. The charging, anthemic \u201cRaise a Little Hell,\u201d also the set\u2019s first video, lays out the band\u2019s live modus operandi, thriving on Bussell\u2019s and Breezy\u2019s chugging beat and the Rev.\u2019s resonator guitar riffs and mantra-like singing. The song was inspired by a show at a folk festival, where one of the promoters \u2014 struck by the Big Damn Band\u2019s raucous, juke joint power \u2014 told the Rev., \u201cY\u2019all sure raise a lot of hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Naw we don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201c the Rev. recalls. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe we do raise a little hell.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sweet, joyful \u201cPot Roast & Kisses,\u201d which the band has also committed to video, was written for Breezy. The Rev. was developing the finger-busting main riff after enjoying one of her pot roast dinners when the lyrics naturally fell into place. \u201cSome people don\u2019t believe that we really live the way we sing about in our songs,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut it\u2019s true.

Flint Eastwood is what happens when friends and family gather in the forgotten spaces of an embattled city and are left to create with no rules, no boundaries, and nothing holding them back. Jax's endless creativity is a byproduct of growing up in a talented family.\n\nHer father was one of ten kids, each of whom played guitar and sang. Her oldest brother, Sam, played in punk bands, and Jax spent her teenage years learning the value of passion and acceptance at DIY shows. As she got older, her other brother (and Flint Eastwood collaborator and producer) Seth started playing in bands throughout the Detroit garage rock scene. Their dad worked as a curb address painter to pay the bills once the housing crash made his job as a mortgage broker invalid. During this time, Jax and her brothers went door to door, passing out flyers advertising her father's services, through some of the toughest residential neighborhoods in Detroit. These struggles helped form the vision that drives Flint Eastwood: to give everyone listening (whether live or on record) a momentary escape from the problems we all have.\n\nBetween helping around the house, Jax spent her days in her family's Detroit-area home, without cable and internet, teaching herself to play her father's 12-string Taylor guitar that he left for them in the living room. It was also during this time that her mother's love for Motown music began to influence Jax's knack for the theatrics and power of the Detroit sound, as Mom played records from The Temptations, the Jackson Five, and Earth Wind & Fire.\n\nOnce old enough to break out on her own, Jax briefly moved to a small German tourist town in rural Georgia, where the only station in town played solely pop and country. There, she fell in love with the hooks and harmonies that define American pop music. Later, she moved with Seth to Los Angeles, to mainly focus on writing for licensing opportunities and playing small clubs and house parties around town. While in LA, Jax developed a love for film, hopping on tour with bands every chance she could get as a self-taught videographer. Her experiences on the West Coast still influence Jax's push to make her musical endeavors into well-rounded multimedia presentations (mixing music with theatrical lighting, video projection, and costumes).\n\nUpon returning home to Detroit at the very beginning of the much-maligned city's recent resurgence, Jax's explosive and endearing personality on stage became the driving force behind Flint Eastwood. But through it all, it was the songs that were always the focus.\n\nOn their now sold-out debut EP Late Nights In Bolo Ties (2013), Jax and her friends mixed elements of pulsing electronic tracks with blistering bluesy guitar licks, all with a spaghetti-western backdrop, inspired by Sunday night movie sessions with Jax and her father.\n\nOn the forthcoming EP, Small Victories (to be released October 23), Jax has returned to her Detroit roots, mixing a taste of the theatricality of Motown music with her more recently found love for pop music. The result is six songs full of hooks. The type of tracks that you turn up a little too loud, close your eyes, and forget where you are for four minutes. In a live setting, the songs are taken to another level entirely, mixing a CHVRCHES-like depth with a twenty | one | pilots-style flair for the dramatic. This approach has led the band to rapidly gain an ever-growing fanbase. Their last two hometown headline plays have sold out (400+ tickets per show), and the band has toured heavily through the Midwest, mixing festival looks like Electric Forest, MoPop Festival, and Midpoint Music Festival with club appearances alongside acts such as Foxy Shazam, Mayer Hawthorne, Betty Who, X Ambassadors, and Andrew WK.\n\nSmall Victories was crafted and polished in Detroit\u2019s second oldest church, now repurposed as Assemble Sound, a hub of Detroit creativity that fosters artists through collaboration. In this crumbling but inspiring location, the new record was created as a coping mechanism to help Jax deal with the loss of her mother, who was her biggest fan and inspiration. As the listener makes their way through the EP, they experience Jax making her way through her mother's illness and passing, railing against it, dealing with the aftermath associated with such a loss, eventually accepting it, and using it as a driving force to continue to create.\n\nJax broke the EP down in one simple thought:\n\n\"Small Victories comes from the idea that doing anything creative in life takes a lot of persistence, struggle, and hustle. It's easy to expect that the spoils will come easily and be immediately fruitful. But if you focus on the little things, the \"small victories\", you realize that it's those things that are the most rewarding. That's what keeps me going.\"\n\nThe lead single is the EP's first track, \"Find What You're Looking For\", which is Jax's interpretation of her mother's final words to her:\n\n\"Don't let this break you\".", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1643528942585214/", "name": "Flint Eastwood, Valley Hush and Air is the Arche 12/3/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2015-12-04T18:00:00-05:00", "description": "Join us for the opening reception of Art Off the Wall, which will be held on Friday, December 4 at the 117 Gallery, in the Ann Arbor Art Center, in conjunction with downtown Ann Arbor\u2019s Midnight Madness!\n\nThis event is open to the public and will include food, drinks and live entertainment. \n\nJOIN US AND TAKE A UNIQUE PIECE OF ART OFF THE WALL!\n\nArt Off the Wall is the Ann Arbor Art Center's annual signature holiday art exhibition.

The ship was lost in Lake Michigan in November 1912, but the captain's wife and family kept up this tradition for 22 years more, well beyond the days of the tall ships on the Great Lakes. There were many Christmas tree ships on the Great Lakes, but the Rouse Simmons is famed for her family. Numerous books, children's stories, and museum exhibits have kept this story alive.

Yet, if you do not know her name, it\u2019s likely because she has spent the past 20 years as a backup singer for the Rolling Stones, Sting, Chris Botti, and countless others. Her name may not be on the marquee, but she doesn\u2019t care. Her astonishing range, spot-on intonation, mastery of the stage, and infectious sweet smile make her the go-to singer for the likes of Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Beyonc\u00e9, Bobby McFerrin, Lou Reed, Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin, and a host of others. As one of the top session and backup singers, she\u2019s featured in the Oscar-winning documentary 20 Feet from Stardom and celebrated for her live concert duets with Mick Jagger during \u201cGimme Shelter\u201d that have also received millions of hits on YouTube. After winning Grammy Awards for \u201cBest Female R&B Performance\u201d (1992) and \u201cBest Music Film\u201d (2015), she has decided to move forward from being a backup singer, putting together her own band and claiming her well-deserved place center stage. \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/ms-lisa-fischer-and-grand-baton", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1020565857968750/", "name": "Ms. Lisa Fischer and Grand Baton", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-01-30T23:00:00-05:00", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Promo Gift Cards* with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Promotional Gift Card for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get $50 free in Promotional Gift Cards for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Holiday Combo Package \nFor only $75 get $50 in Gift Cards and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks. \n\nMSV Distinctive Recipes Cookbook\nOur MSV Distinctive Recipes cookbook lets you share in the experience of preparing uniquely styled entr\u00e9es and award-winning recipes.

Over the next five years he made a name for himself as an energetic and charismatic performer, both onstage and on albums such as his 1998 self-titled debut and the following year's Surfin' USA, both of which were successful in Japan and Germany as well as in the States. A single on the Pokemon: The First Movie soundtrack, opening gigs for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears, a biography and video collection, and appearances on Nickelodeon set the stage for his third album, 2000's Aaron's Party (Come Get It). The party continued on Oh Aaron, which was issued in summer 2001. Successful tours with both the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears kept him busy into the next year, but by the spring of 2002 he was back in the studio again. Calling on several big-name pop producers, Carter put together Another Earthquake! during the year and released it that fall.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/567", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1725536331010947/", "name": "Aaron Carter 2/24/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-02-25T20:00:00-05:00", "description": "The Irish band whose name means \"power.\" Dinner-show combination available at Conor O'Neill's.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1106672679351325/", "name": "Comas", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-02-25T21:00:00-05:00", "description": "Nashville-based, independent artist, Ron Pope, has stood at a crossroads where so many musicians find themselves \u2014 at the intersection of record label and independence.

Zafir features virtuoso composer and musical director Simon Shaheen with his group Qantara, acclaimed Tunisian singer Sonia M\u2019barek, flamenco musician Juan P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez, and the fiery young flamenco dancer Auxi Fernandez, who completes the music with her explosive footwork. \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/zafir-simon-shaheen/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/419604171550681/", "name": "Zafir: Musical Winds from North Africa to Andaluc\u00eda", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Legendary guitar mastery", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1512513839062559/", "name": "Leo Kottke", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Saturday, April 16, 2016, 8:00 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\nOf the three major orchestras based in Munich, the Bavarian Radio Orchestra is the most prominent, with a string of eminent music directors including Rafael Kubelik, Sir Colin Davis, Lorin Maazel, and, since 2003, Mariss Jansons.

The saxophonist was embraced by the jazz mainstream on the release of 1994\u2019s Moodswing, and he\u2019s been both a critical and commercial favorite ever since. The Bad Plus, by contrast, have courted controversy since the release of their 2003 major label debut, These Are the Vistas. But when Joshua Redman joined the idiosyncratic trio as a special guest a few years back, a brilliant collaboration was born. Redman\u2019s melodic prowess blends seamlessly with the \u201cavant-garde populism\u201d of The Bad Plus, pushing the boundaries of jazz beyond all imagination. Metroland describes this new all-star quartet best: \u201cIt\u2019s as though Redman is the long-lost fourth member of the group, just waiting to be snapped snugly into place.\u201d \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/the-bad-plus-joshua-redman", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1589849627952742/", "name": "The Bad Plus Joshua Redman", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "New music from an expat Australian trio", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/831801416940807/", "name": "The Waifs", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Michigan's cult hero of comedy", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/480751802102134/", "name": "Heywood Banks", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-05-06T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "An American master of solo songwriting and blues", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/986462064751963/", "name": "Chris Smither", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-05-07T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "\"Her songs are about living, breathing people.\"\u2014No Depression", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/916584281712332/", "name": "Lucy Kaplansky", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-05-07T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "\"Her songs are about living, breathing people.\"\u2014No Depression", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/483349811834793/", "name": "Lucy Kaplansky", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-05-09T00:00:00-04:00", "description": "Give the Gift of Fine Dining\nEnjoy FREE MSV Promo Gift Cards* with your purchase.\n\nPurchase $250 or more in Gift Cards and get a free $25 Promotional Gift Card for every $250 spent.     \n\nPurchase $1,000 or more in Gift Cards, and get $50 free in Promotional Gift Cards for every $250 spent. \n\nMSV Holiday Combo Package \nFor only $75 get $50 in Gift Cards and TWO Distinctive Recipes Cookbooks. \n\nMSV Distinctive Recipes Cookbook\nOur MSV Distinctive Recipes cookbook lets you share in the experience of preparing uniquely styled entr\u00e9es and award-winning recipes.
