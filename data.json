It follows the narrator Isabel as she navigates uncertain terrain after losing her best friend in a car accident. While this sounds like the making of a downer of a novel, it is in fact full of humor and hope, with the only darkness being the narrator\u2019s pitch perfect black humor. Isabel\u2019s biting wit and endearing neuroses make you relate to her in so many situations, even as you watch her fumble throughout. Her musings on the absurdity of adult life will make you laugh and cry, and perhaps a little of both at the same time. And you\u2019ll enjoy it all along the way. \"\n\nCelebrated for her irresistibly witty, strikingly intelligent examinations of friendship and marriage, Lauren Fox (\u201cAn immensely gifted writer\u2014a writer adept at capturing the sad-funny mess that happens to be one woman\u2019s life\u201d \u2014Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times) has written her most powerful novel to date. Days of Awe is the story of a woman who, in the wake of her best friend\u2019s sudden death, must face the crisis in her marriage, the fury of her almost-teenage daughter, and the possibility of opening her cantankerous heart to someone new.\n\nOnly a year ago Isabel Moore was married, was the object of adoration for her ten-year-old daughter, and thought she knew everything about her wild, extravagant, beloved best friend, Josie. But in that one short year her husband moved out and rented his own apartment; her daughter grew into a moody insomniac; and Josie\u2014impulsive, funny, secretive Josie\u2014was killed behind the wheel in a single-car accident. As the relationships that long defined Isabel\u2014wife, mother, daughter, best friend\u2014change before her eyes, Isabel must try to understand who she really is. \n\nTeeming with longing, grief, and occasional moments of wild, surprising joy, Days of Awe is a daring, dazzling book\u2014a luminous exploration of marriage, motherhood, and the often surprising shape of new love.\n\nLauren Fox is the author of the novels Still Life with Husband and Friends Like Us. She earned her MFA from the University of Minnesota, and her work has appeared in numerous publications including The New York Times, Marie Claire, Parenting, Psychology Today, The Rumpus, and Salon. She lives in Milwaukee with her husband and two daughters.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/506534946162444/", "date": "2015-08-12T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "B\u00d8RNS w/ Chris Bathgate 8/13 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch (FREE)", "description": "B\u00d8RNS - The nom de plume of singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and Michigan native Garrett Borns, B\u00f8rns, crafts big-hearted, alternately dreamy and danceable, falsetto-driven electro-pop confections that have been dusted with glam rock and folk.

Whether the project is long- or short-term, moving image or still photography, single pictures, multiple projections, or an installation, it is through close observation, careful listening, and an embrace of chance that I establish the bedrock. . . . Regardless of the tools and the form, the project is . . . life drawing.\u201d\n\t\nThe dual-gallery presentation of Life Drawing at UMMA underscores Cohen\u2019s use of disparate media that, rooted in a shared set of concerns and working methods, organically coalesce into a broader body of work.\n\t\nWe Have an Anchor, on view in the Media Gallery, is a single-channel video projection that incorporates composited 16mm, Super 8, and HD imagery. An environmental portrait of Nova Scotia, it takes its departure point from a live performance with multiple projections where Cohen collaborated with an ensemble of musicians to make what has been described as a cinematic love letter to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton. Footage of the island, gathered over 10 years, is interspersed with texts ranging from poems to local folklore, buoyed by both environmental sounds and an original score written and performed by members from a diverse group of bands, including Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Dirty Three, Fugazi, White Magic, Silver Mt. Zion, and The Quavers.\n\t\nIn the Photography Gallery, more than 25 still photographs, again gathered over a long period in a disappearing analog format (in this case, Polaroid film), are subtly married to digital technology. The images, some urban and some domestic, are from a variety of locations ranging from New York to Tangier. With both the video and the photographs Cohen uses a strategy of free wandering conjoined with careful documentation in order to unearth and celebrate hidden, seemingly haunted geographies and their human (and animal) inhabitants.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1000250803360828/", "date": "2015-08-15T11:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Doctor Who Comics Day!", "description": "Vault of Midnight Dr. Who Day Breakdown: 8/15/2015\n\n4:00 - Event Room is opened for coloring, trivia, promotion material, and puzzles.

As a young girl growing up in an affluent suburb bordering Detroit, Alice Townley witnesses a tragic accident at her parents\u2019 lavish party. In the years that follow, Alice is left mostly in the care of the household staff, free to forge friendships with other pampered and damaged teens.

A WWII veteran sleepwalks out of his home at night, led by vivid flashbacks. A Buddhist monk is assaulted by a robber while seated in meditation. A teenaged girl is shot walking home from the corner store with a friend.

The event is free and open to the public.\n\nEndzone tells the story of how college football's most successful, richest and respected program almost lost all three in less than a decade - and entirely of its own doing. It is a story of hubris, greed, and betrayal - a tale more suited to Wall Street than the world's top public university. \nAuthor John U. Bacon takes you inside the offices, the board rooms and the locker rooms of the University of Michigan to see what happened, and why - with countless eye-opening, head-shaking scenes of conflict and conquest. \n\nBut Endzone is also an inspiring story of redemption and revival. When those who loved Michigan football the most recognized it was being attacked from within, they rallied to reclaim the values that made it great for over a century -- values that went deeper than dollars. The list of heroes includes players, students, lettermen, fans and faculty - and the leaders who had the courage to listen to them.\n\nTheir unprecedented uprising produced a new athletic director, and a new coach - the hottest in the land - who vindicated the fans' faith when he turned down more money and fame to return to the place he loved most: Michigan. \n\nIf you love a good story, you'll want to dive into Endzone: The Rise, Fall and Return of Michigan Football.\n\nJohn U.

One band stood out by hot-wiring that sound with the subversive energy of some American bands of the era and that band was Swervedriver. They had the liquid distortion of shoegaze combined with the cool swagger of H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Sonic Youth, and Dinosaur Jr - giving them a unique sound and attitude.\n\nRelocating from Oxford to London, guitarists Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge, bassist Adi Vines and drummer Graham Bonnar debuted with a series of landmark Creation Records EPs, Son of Mustang Ford, Rave Down, and Sandblasted. Their full-length debut, 1991's Raise, to this day is hailed by Pitchfork as an album full of \"muscular, scorching guitars\" that \"still bring the noise like nobody's business\" with Mojo stating that Son of Mustang Ford \"remains one of the most glorious tunes to emerge in the wake of the so-called grunge explosion of '89, matching Adam Franklin and Jim Hartridge's motorised guitar-weaving with a beguiling, below-the-line vocal melody and lyrics that celebrated the joy of wide-open American freeways.\"\n\nThe band toured the album extensively, including a lengthy US tour with Soundgarden that brought their wall of sound to thousands. However with both Bonnar and Vines leaving the band not long after, the 1992 EP Never Lose That Feeling looked like it might be Swervedriver's (albeit scorching) swan song. Then in late 1992, Franklin and Hartridge demoed a new tune \"Duress,\" recruited drummer Jez Hindmarsh and set about recording a second full-length albumMezcal Head with Alan Moulder (My Bloody Valentine/Led Zeppelin), which included their biggest singles \"Duel\" and \"Last Train To Satansville.\" Touring extensively again, this time with Smashing Pumpkins and Medicine and with new bass player Steve George onboard, their sound was further imprinted on people's minds.\n\nMore roadblocks came to be in their way though: highly revered third album Ejector Seat Reservation came out in 1995 but was never released or toured in the US and although the band returned strongly with their fourth full-length 1998's 99th Dream, the energy was dissipating and they imploded at the end of an Australian tour resolving to go on hiatus.\n\nGoing their separate ways - Franklin moved to the US and released solo albums with his band Bolts of Melody - no-one really knew if the band actually was on hiatus or had split entirely. Then came an announcement in late 2007 that they would be performing at the following year's Coachella and heading back out on the road. Originally reforming with Hindmarsh on drums followed briefly by the return of Bonnar, they finally settled on Mikey Jones of Heaven and Bolts of Melody and have continued touring and appearing at festivals internationally.\n\nIn 2013 everything was ratcheted up several notches when Swervedriver released its first single in 15 years, \"Deep Wound.\" Spin Magazine called it a \"warm, confidently roiling return\" with Mojo adding \"those same distorted pop sensibilities remain reassuringly intact\" and the band debuted the song on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" in the States.\n\nAnd finally the announcement comes that the band has been recording at legendary studios Birdland in Melbourne, and Konk in London. Their fifth album I Wasn't Born To Lose You is to be released worldwide in March of 2015. \n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/394", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1593112314290021/", "date": "2015-09-10T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Christopher Moore", "description": "Literati is thrilled to welcome Christopher Moore to Ann Arbor to read from his latest, Secondhand Souls.

September 19 | 9pm | 18+ | $20 Cover\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/421\n\nThe members of MUTEMATH had reached their breaking point. Collectively gathered on the front porch of their New Orleans home-studio where they were struggling to record the follow up to their 2006 critically-acclaimed Teleprompt/ Warner Bros. debut, the quartet screamed at each other with the full weight of the accumulated frustrations that had escalated from weeks of fighting. To heighten the tension, a lawn mower droning in the background drowned out their voices, inciting them to yell even louder in misguided efforts to be heard.  Finally, drummer Darren King voiced what everyone was thinking, but feared saying out loud: either call it quits or swallow their individual pride and try to write the best songs they ever had. No one said a word at that point, recalls vocalist/frontman Paul Meany. And without comment, apology or agreeing, I just remember all of us walking right back inside, going straight to our instruments, and just starting to play music. That was the day King, Meany, guitarist Greg Hill, and bassist Roy Mitchell-C\u00e1rdenas began to write what would become Armistice.  But before that day would arrive, the band had written close to 16 songs in the midst of their 3 years on the road and had full intention of arriving in New Orleans to record and sculpt these ideas into the 10 or so songs they would need for their sophomore release. But after weeks of recording and working in every separate corner of an old uptown voodoo Victorian, the internal conflicts over what parts made up the best ideas began building to a full on creative stalemate.  Growing exhausted with their crumbling democracy, the band started looking for an outside producer to evaluate the situation. One by one, they were flown in every other day for a week until they met Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse, Elvis Costello, The Hives).\n\u201cWhat caught our attention about Dennis was that he had the most simple, yet slightly offensive suggestion for us,\u201d says Meany about their first visit. Upon hearing what had been recorded so far Herring said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just try writing some new songs?\nI\u2019m surprised no one had really entertained that option up until then, Meany comments, perhaps because it seemed like too daunting of a task considering how invested we\u2019d become in the existing ideas. But Herring continued to push his point, You obviously aren\u2019t happy with what you have, and honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great either. Stop spinning your wheels; shelve these songs; and start spending your time writing together. Don\u2019t worry about recording your record right now. Just write it.\u201d\nTaking a few days to think about it after Herring left, the band attempted a discussion on what to do next, but still could not come to any unanimous agreements until that noteworthy day on the front porch where all the conflict would come to a head.\nAll of the constant fighting had left us unable to resolve anything, remembers Mitchell-C\u00e1rdenas. But something special happened when we just decided to shut our mouths, pick up our instruments, and disregard anything we had written prior. Something began to align in the creative universe. Songs were forming on their own at a fast pace, almost as if their true sound was being discovered for the first time. It was in this moment that their first single Spotlight fell out of the sky.\nOnce the band had grasped the benefit of their new mindset, they didn\u2019t waste any more time. All previous 16 ideas were completely scrapped and the band began to work together in the same room everyday just starting with a tempo and key to play in. It turned into a marathon style writing session yielding a new song about every other day. The band eventually signed on Herring as their official producer and after 3 months in New Orleans shaping up almost 20 brand new songs, they headed to Oxford, MS and worked more closely with Herring to put the final details in place.  Fueled by the band\u2019s chaos and confusion, MUTEMATH has created a work of tremendous beauty and meaning on Armistice via such tracks as the hypnotic, musically inventive Clipping, the propulsive, high dynamic charge of The Nerve, the quirky tribute to Murphy\u2019s Law Backfire, and the nine-minute, soaring, closing opus Burden.  Instead of brushing aside the questions and anxiety that propelled the project\u2019s birth, the quartet embraces them, with each song questioning where to go from here.\nSince MUTEMATH released its first EP in late 2004 and hit the road in 2005, their inherent nature has challenged limitations and expanded parameters. By the time of the 2006 self-titled debut, their blending of adverse genres into its own innovative sonically adventurous creation earned them a reputation as one of modern music\u2019s most daring young groups. By 2007, they would find themselves Grammy nominated and declared by Alternative Press as the #1 band you need to see live before you die. But in the process of pushing boundaries even further for themselves, they almost pushed themselves out of existence. It was a risk we had to take, says King looking back on what they set out to accomplish for Armistice. This record was by far the most painful music-making experience I\u2019ve ever had, but also the one I\u2019m most proud of.\nIt\u2019s evident that this record is not a high-minded story with a beautiful resolve, but rather the experience of knowing when to stop fighting for the sake of progress.

The first decade was full of hope for a new social order that would reject the values and traditions of Tsarist rule. Centered in Moscow, a group of young artists, spearheaded in part by Vladimir (1899-1982) and Georgy Stenberg (1900-1933), championed an art that promoted the egalitarian ideals of the New Order and contributed to the growth of the Soviet Union. Known as the Constructivists, they advocated for utilitarian art that was easily accessible and spoke to the masses. Among their most provocative and visionary works were posters advertising Soviet films.\n\t\nUMMA\u2019s exhibition, Soviet Constructivist Posters: Branding the New Order features a selection of posters by the Stenbergs and other Constructivists for some of early cinema\u2019s most inventive films including, Sergei Eisenstein\u2019sOctober and Dziga Vertov\u2019s Man with a Movie Camera.\n\t\nUsing dynamic compositions, bold colors, and emblematic images, these posters announced that the Soviet Union was a progressive nation that could propel society into a utopian future. Their revolutionary aesthetic became associated with the workers\u2019 movement and helped to shape how it was understood both at home and abroad. Though Constructivism went out of favor in the 1930s with the rise of Joseph Stalin (1878\u20131953), Constructivist designs continued to have an influence abroad. Today, their legacy can be seen in advertisements and other promotional materials made for the public eye.\n\t\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Weiser Center for Emerging Democracies and the Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/504714833012958/", "date": "2015-09-26T11:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Storytime at the Museum", "description": "Children ages four to seven are invited to hear a story in the galleries.

Heck, even they\u2019d cop to a few, like Ricky Nelson and The Clash. But once those same RIYL tags have been filtered through the minds and hands and voices of this five-piece, there\u2019s simply nothing else like it.\n\nThe Growlers took the phrase \u201cBeach Goth\u201d as an apt descriptor of their music. Sunburned and salty, that term perfectly describes their distinctive melding of reverb heavy surf guitar and Bakersfield-style honky tonk with \u201880s post-punk.\n\nThis is especially true of Chinese Fountain, The Growlers\u2019 fifth full-length set to be released on September 23rd via Everloving Records. The 11 songs found on it are some of the strongest that they\u2019ve committed to tape yet; a byproduct not only of eight years in the trenches together, but finely honing their gypsy folk dirges and psychedelic sea shanties to fans at close to 150 shows each year. The connection between vocalist Brooks Nielsen and guitarist Matt Taylor (the principal songwriters of the group) has only grown deeper.\n\n\u201cThe band played better than they\u2019ve ever played,\u201d says Nielsen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the process down now. There\u2019s less screwing around to get the songs laid out and we weren\u2019t waiting around for take after take. We knew it and we played without much time to spare.\u201d\nThat confidence bleeds through every track on Chinese Fountain, with the band assured enough to layer in shades of many new influences: the loping ska beat of \u201cDull Boy\u201d and \u201cGoing Gets Tuff,\u201d the playful disco beat behind the title track, or the Teardrop Explodes-like agitation of \u201cGood Advice.\u201d\n\nNot that the band left themselves much room to second-guess anything. The five spent about three weeks writing the tracks, and about half that time in the studio recording them. That may sound rushed, but it\u2019s not as if you can hear any strain on the finished product; Chinese Fountain is as rock solid and watertight as anything in their still-growing discography.\n\nThere\u2019s evolution to be heard in Chinese Fountain as well, courtesy of some of Nielsen\u2019s most pointed and poignant lyrics to date. He takes our obsession with the online world to task on the funky title track. When he drops the bomb that obliterates that most famous of Beatles\u2019 claims with \"The internet is bigger than Jesus or John Lennon\u201d he re-contextualizes Marshall McLuhan's \"the medium is the message\" in the same breath. He urges positivity no matter the obstacles (\u201cGoing Gets Tuff\u201d). Too, he reveals a tattered heart to the world on tracks like \u201cRare Hearts\u201d and \u201cLove Test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my chance to let it all out,\u201d Nielsen says of these songs. \u201cI kind of bottle things up and don\u2019t really get emotional. But I think if I don\u2019t open up, I\u2019d be a really stale person.\u201d\n\nWSG: The Babe Rainbow\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/392", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1639454666285655/", "date": "2015-10-01T21:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Rubblebucket w/ ELEL 10/3/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "description": "Sat.

Vacillating from somber-yet-soaring melodies on one track to pummeling metal heft on the next, Memorial sounds like an album with split personalities. \n \nWhere one song showcases guitarist Mike Sullivan, drummer Dave Turncrantz and bassist/keyboardist Brian Cook's mastery of lush melancholic melody, the next exhibits their most abrasive underground metal leaning sound, with washed-out 16th-note riffs and crushing rhythms. The band's penchant for endless hooks remains a constant, but Memorial embodies their most dramatic ranges in tone.  \n \n\"We've always tried to balance our metal-influenced sounds with more nuanced, pretty, orchestral elements,\" Cook says. \"But this time, it's far more polarized in that the heavy parts are much more blown out and exaggerated while the pretty moments are far more restrained, delicate, and atmospheric.\" In the two years since Russian Circles released their landmark fourth album Empros, the Chicago trio toured worldwide nearly incessantly, encountering many heavy acts whose music seemed needlessly complicated. \"We set out to make a straightforward, intense, heavy record,\" Cook explains. \"We subconsciously gravitated toward darker and more somber sounds.

Rapper AK started rapping at 11 years old and his partner Issa Gold started 6 years ago. Raised together in Flatbush, Brooklyn, they established THE UNDERACHIEVERS in 2011 and have been creating music together ever since. In May 2012, the group released their debut video for \"So Devilish\" and everything began to take off from there. Since then, the group has gained more than 24 million views on YouTube, 125,000+ YouTube subscribers and solid reviews from all of the top music publications. The Underachievers released the critically acclaimed INDIGOISM in February of 2013. The debut mix tape received an eight out of ten from Pitchfolk.com and has since gone PLATINUM on DatPiff. The mix tape has been downloaded over 300k times and has accumulated over 745k views on the unique website. It has been heralded as one of the best projects of 2013 and it has served as an excellent tool to establish the reputation of the group. In August of 2013, UA released their second project \"The Lords of Flatbush\" produced entirely by the extraordinary producer LEX LUGER. Again the mix tape was released on DatPiff and it amassed over 155k downloads making it a GOLD release on the site. In 2014, the group headlined their first tour \u201cEyes of the World\u201d across North America, Canada & Europe. In August of the same year, UA also released their debut album on the RPM MSC label entitled \"Cellar Door: Terminus Ut Exordium\".

The main purpose of UA\u2019s music is to aide in the enlightenment of their generation by providing music from a perspective that all can appreciate and enjoy but still keeping it positive and as \"true to hip hop\" as they can. By combining their strong points they have been able to establish themselves as a rising reputable force in Hip Hop and the music Industry.

The following year brought further collaboration with Front Drive in a split 10\u201d. With a growing fan base in an emerging genre, they were ready to create their second album, Departures and Landfalls.\n\nWhile on tour, the band became a tighter unit and developed focus by talking about music and planning their future creative direction. They all saw Departures as their first opportunity to document new songs that could help define an original sound. With stronger songcraft, a refined tone, and a solid creative process, the work they created remained abrasive but also incorporated warmth and depth.\n\nGeography and seasons affected the process; some songs were written on the road, with an ever-changing landscape, and many during the springtime and early summer. Late nights of long drives, longer talks, and doing what you love are what made Departures Boys Life\u2019s first real record, full of new but classic sounds. They had made something of their own.\n\nDuring five days of a hot summer in Chicago in 1996, they recorded with Bob Weston in the home studio of Steve Albini. In the band\u2019s maturity, they were rehearsing almost daily and decided to record the album live. Several first takes made the final cut, and the resulting songs sounded natural and organic, reflecting the true dynamic of the band and their live performance.\n\nAfter the record\u2019s release, Boys Life co-headlined tours with Kerosene 454 and Bluetip. Their performances were loud, enthusiastic, and genuine, and the experience strengthened the band\u2019s newfound bonds with those in DC sharing the same postpunk ethic. By the end of that touring cycle, however, citing exhaustion, they called it a day in the summer of 1997.\n\nNow, nearly twenty years later, Boys Life is ready to revisit their records with renewed energy. Both the band and their songs were products of a special time that can\u2019t be replicated, only revisited. But then and now, both Boys Life and Departures and Landfalls reflect something more than nostalgia\u2014creativity, the power of music, the roar of a thunderstorm, and the lonesome sound of a train whistle.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/398616826996922/", "date": "2015-10-19T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Israel Nash 10/27/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "description": "Cosmos-wrangling Americana upstart Israel Nash returns from Texas Hill Country with his Silver Season, a deeply gorgeous and wholly immersive nine-song set that plays less like an album, and more like a cross section of time and space.

Black Girl \u2014 Linguistic Play speaks to the complexities of carving out a positive identity as a Black female in urban American culture.\n\nIn a world where Black women are often portrayed only in terms of their strength, resiliency, or trauma, this work interrogates these narratives by presenting a fuller spectrum of the black female and the complexities of negotiating in this racially and politically charged world. The work uses elements of African-American social dancing, rhythmic play, and musical compositions to better illustrate who \u201cBlack Girl\u201d knows herself to be. Brown\u2019s choreography is \u201cfun, inventive, and watchable.\u201d (Times Square Chronicles) Program will also include other repertoire.\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/camille-a-brown-dancers/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/368546533344933/", "date": "2016-02-13T20:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Sir Andr\u00e1s Schiff, piano", "description": "February 16, 18\nRackham Auditorium\n\nOf \u201cThe Last Sonatas,\u201d Sir Andr\u00e1s Schiff says, \u201c\u2019Alle guten Dinge sind drei\u2019 \u2014 all good things are three, according to this German proverb that must have been well-known to Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert.
