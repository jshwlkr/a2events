Nov. 18 | 9pm | 18+ | $10 Cover\n\nAlex Bleeker and the Freaks\nwith Bonny Doon & Elroy Meltzer\n\nUnder the moniker, Alex Bleeker & the Freaks, Jersey\u00adbred songwriter Alex Bleeker has developed a solo career outside of his bass playing duties for Real Estate. Bringing together like\u00adminded players and friends, he and his able\u00adminded Freaks crafted two separate albums of material, a low\u00adkey self\u00adtitled release in 2009 and a more full\u00adbodied 2013 record entitled How Far Away.\n\nAlex Bleeker and the Freaks\u2019 third album Country Agenda is the culmination of Bleeker\u2019s songwriting, as well as the gelling together of a fully formed band. With the full\u00adtime inclusion of guitarist Alex Steinberg, bassist Nick Lenchner, drummer Dylan Shumaker and keyboardist Jacob Wolf, along with occasional guest vocals from Mountain Man singer Molly Sarle, The Freaks\u2019 vibe has coalesced considerably.\n\nNo longer the work of a single director, this version of the band gives the songs more room to breathe, allowing the tunes to move in unexpected directions. A wholly collaborative effort, Country Agenda features multiple songwriters and ensemble playing that stretches out in unhurried passages of glowing musical interplay. The songs wander in slow motion like a coastline drive, drawing on the same wizened energy and brilliant restraint as Crazy Horse, the Dead, Moby Grape and other like\u00adminded cosmic travelers. Easily the most realized and best sounding set of tunes from the project, the strengths of the album are magnified by a cohesive feeling that was absent on previous Freaks records. The sound here is undeniably the birth of a solid band playing together, locked in the groove, and moving down the road in unison.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/502", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-11-18T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Alex Bleeker & The Freaks 11/18/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/904173979677626/", "description": "Michigan Theater\n603 E Liberty St\nAnn Arbor, MI 48104\nPrem Krishnamurthy is a founding principal of the award-winning design studio Project Projects and the director/curator of the critically-acclaimed multidisciplinary exhibition space P!.

Sure our phones are smart now, but let\u2019s consider the value of making other electronic devices intelligent enough to sense and transmit useful information - such as getting a heads up from your fridge before you\u2019ve poured recently-spoiled milk over your cereal. We\u2019ll review the sweeter side of presidential history with a project that re-interprets U.S. presidents as cupcakes, a lens through which even the worst policy decisions can become into melt-in-your-mouth magic. And finally, we\u2019ll think about using social media to encourage voters to get to the polls, instead of as a method of sharing cat videos - and with the November election just behind us, we\u2019ll even get to hear about how well it works! So come hungry for nanotechnology, Commander in Chief-flavored cupcakes, and civic-minded social media and join us for another nerdy good time.\n\nWhen: Thursday, November 19, 2015, doors at 6:30pm, talks at 7pm!\nWhere: LIVE, 102 S First St, Ann Arbor\n$$$: NO COVER!

The next technological revolution will be turning every appliance we use into a smart device. To create these devices, we need tiny sensors to allow the electronics to interact with the environment. Today these sensors are too large or too expensive, but luckily, engineers are working to reduce this sensor size and cost with the help of nano-electronics.\n\nAbout Matt: Matt is a doctorate student at the University of Michigan. For the past few years, he has worked heavily with semiconductor nanostructures in efforts to improve the future of solar and indoor lighting technologies. In his free time he enjoys hiking with his dog, music, and movies/television.\n\nSherlonya Turner - 35 Offbeat Ways of Looking at the POTUS\nSometimes the President of the United States seems larger than life. This humorous talk will bring them down to size with anecdotes that present them as more man than myth. The Head of State Cakes project, in which a cake recipe is created in honor of each president, is what happens when you cross a lifelong interest in presidential history with a love of baking. The results are not only tasty, they\u2019re pretty fun to talk about.\n\nAbout Sherlonya: Sherlonya has an all-consuming and perhaps overwhelming love for the presidents. She's interested in them less as politicians and more as men. Her history degree helps her put things in context. Her library degree gives her research tips and tricks. Her love of cooking has inspired her to create a tribute cupcake for each US President; see them all at headofstatecakes.com. Her son is tired of hearing her talk about Lyndon Baines Johnson, her president boyfriend.\n\nSam Firke - Twitterbot Says Vote!\nThere are 90,000 registered voters in Ann Arbor. Most don't vote.

Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band bridges genres and eras with an intensity and effortlessness few contemporary artists possess. And their new album So Deliciouselevates the trio\u2019s work to a new level. Produced by Rev. Peyton, So Delicious offers the band\u2019s most diverse collection of songs buoyed by the Rev.\u2019s supercharged six-string virtuosity \u2014 a unique style of fingerpicking inspired by his Delta blues heroes, but taken to new, original heights.\n\nThe fifth full-length original album by the group \u2014 which includes Breezy Peyton on washboard and supporting vocals and Ben Bussell on drums and supporting vocals \u2014 is their debut on Yazoo Records, a label known for the historic reissues of blues and other old time American music that are the bedrock inspiration for the Rev.\u2019s sound and approach.\n\n\u201cYazoo was my favorite record label growing up,\u201d he explains. \u201cFor fans of old country blues and all manner of early American music, they are the quintessential label. And for me, it\u2019s like being on the same label as Charley Patton and \u2018Mississippi\u2019 John Hurt. To think that Yazoo believes we are authentic enough to stand with the other people in their catalog means a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band has always been strong on authenticity, playing music that blends blues, ragtime, folk, country and other traditional styles with the sleek modern energy of do-it-yourself, homespun, punk fueled rock. And performing tunes plucked from their lives, their community or from the canonical songbook that fed the Rev. Peyton\u2019s formative creative identity. It\u2019s a mix that\u2019s allowed the band to win fans from all corners of the Americana and rock worlds, and bring a new generation to blues and other forms of American roots music.\n\nSo Delicious is a perfect Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band album, with songs that speak from the heart and capture the trio \u2014 whose sound has been honed over 250 annual tour dates during the last eight years \u2014 playing at their peak. The charging, anthemic \u201cRaise a Little Hell,\u201d also the set\u2019s first video, lays out the band\u2019s live modus operandi, thriving on Bussell\u2019s and Breezy\u2019s chugging beat and the Rev.\u2019s resonator guitar riffs and mantra-like singing. The song was inspired by a show at a folk festival, where one of the promoters \u2014 struck by the Big Damn Band\u2019s raucous, juke joint power \u2014 told the Rev., \u201cY\u2019all sure raise a lot of hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Naw we don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201c the Rev. recalls. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe we do raise a little hell.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sweet, joyful \u201cPot Roast & Kisses,\u201d which the band has also committed to video, was written for Breezy. The Rev. was developing the finger-busting main riff after enjoying one of her pot roast dinners when the lyrics naturally fell into place. \u201cSome people don\u2019t believe that we really live the way we sing about in our songs,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut it\u2019s true.

Autumnal aromas of crisp apple and earthy wet leaves mingle with sweet-tart sour cherry. Rich, vinous wet tobacco and juicy fruits on the palate are complemented by subtle chocolate and caramel notes and balanced by lactic acidity, tart green apple and dry tannins that persist through a long and slightly mineral finish.\n\nFramboise 2015 - Our take on this classic style is neither spontaneously fermented nor barrel aged, but the addition of lactic acid and raspberries to our crisp Blonde create a flavor that is refreshingly tart without being aggressively sour or acidic. A crisp and refreshing brew with tart raspberry, and subtle notes of zesty orange peel and spicy coriander.\n\nAnniversary Barleywine 2015 - Our 20th anniversary ale combines the best of all worlds \u2013 big, rich malts with plenty of nutty and caramel sweetness; the bitterness of a heavy-handed dose of resiny locally grown hops; and the warming alcohols you would expect in a high gravity brew. An American Barleywine brewed with predominantly Thomas Fawcett malts and Michigan-grown Chinook hops. We brewed this bad boy in honor of our 20th anniversary because a big celebration demanded a big beer! And since running a brewery is sometimes sweet and sometimes sour, we decided to pull off a portion of the beer to sour in our cellar... \n\nAnniversary Sour Barleywine 2015 - We like our sour beers big and rich, and sometimes even bitter so our hoppy anniversary barleywine was the perfect base beer for this special celebration ale. Floral, woodsy and hoppy aromas leads into an incredibly complex palate with toffee and caramel, a hint of sweet tart pineapple, notes of charred wood, sweet citrus and tangy grapefruit fading into a long and bracingly bitter finish.\n\nAll selections are only available at the Brewpub.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-11-27T11:30:00-05:00", "name": "Drink me now or lay me down, a sale of cellar bottles"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/991614417546900/", "description": "This original holiday romp is inspired by the British tradition of Pantomime (or Panto) - which is like a crazy mash up between a musical comedy, a vaudeville act, an old-fashioned melodrama and a parade - a truly raucous evening's entertainment.

Flint Eastwood is what happens when friends and family gather in the forgotten spaces of an embattled city and are left to create with no rules, no boundaries, and nothing holding them back. Jax's endless creativity is a byproduct of growing up in a talented family.\n\nHer father was one of ten kids, each of whom played guitar and sang. Her oldest brother, Sam, played in punk bands, and Jax spent her teenage years learning the value of passion and acceptance at DIY shows. As she got older, her other brother (and Flint Eastwood collaborator and producer) Seth started playing in bands throughout the Detroit garage rock scene. Their dad worked as a curb address painter to pay the bills once the housing crash made his job as a mortgage broker invalid. During this time, Jax and her brothers went door to door, passing out flyers advertising her father's services, through some of the toughest residential neighborhoods in Detroit. These struggles helped form the vision that drives Flint Eastwood: to give everyone listening (whether live or on record) a momentary escape from the problems we all have.\n\nBetween helping around the house, Jax spent her days in her family's Detroit-area home, without cable and internet, teaching herself to play her father's 12-string Taylor guitar that he left for them in the living room. It was also during this time that her mother's love for Motown music began to influence Jax's knack for the theatrics and power of the Detroit sound, as Mom played records from The Temptations, the Jackson Five, and Earth Wind & Fire.\n\nOnce old enough to break out on her own, Jax briefly moved to a small German tourist town in rural Georgia, where the only station in town played solely pop and country. There, she fell in love with the hooks and harmonies that define American pop music. Later, she moved with Seth to Los Angeles, to mainly focus on writing for licensing opportunities and playing small clubs and house parties around town. While in LA, Jax developed a love for film, hopping on tour with bands every chance she could get as a self-taught videographer. Her experiences on the West Coast still influence Jax's push to make her musical endeavors into well-rounded multimedia presentations (mixing music with theatrical lighting, video projection, and costumes).\n\nUpon returning home to Detroit at the very beginning of the much-maligned city's recent resurgence, Jax's explosive and endearing personality on stage became the driving force behind Flint Eastwood. But through it all, it was the songs that were always the focus.\n\nOn their now sold-out debut EP Late Nights In Bolo Ties (2013), Jax and her friends mixed elements of pulsing electronic tracks with blistering bluesy guitar licks, all with a spaghetti-western backdrop, inspired by Sunday night movie sessions with Jax and her father.\n\nOn the forthcoming EP, Small Victories (to be released October 23), Jax has returned to her Detroit roots, mixing a taste of the theatricality of Motown music with her more recently found love for pop music. The result is six songs full of hooks. The type of tracks that you turn up a little too loud, close your eyes, and forget where you are for four minutes. In a live setting, the songs are taken to another level entirely, mixing a CHVRCHES-like depth with a twenty | one | pilots-style flair for the dramatic. This approach has led the band to rapidly gain an ever-growing fanbase. Their last two hometown headline plays have sold out (400+ tickets per show), and the band has toured heavily through the Midwest, mixing festival looks like Electric Forest, MoPop Festival, and Midpoint Music Festival with club appearances alongside acts such as Foxy Shazam, Mayer Hawthorne, Betty Who, X Ambassadors, and Andrew WK.\n\nSmall Victories was crafted and polished in Detroit\u2019s second oldest church, now repurposed as Assemble Sound, a hub of Detroit creativity that fosters artists through collaboration. In this crumbling but inspiring location, the new record was created as a coping mechanism to help Jax deal with the loss of her mother, who was her biggest fan and inspiration. As the listener makes their way through the EP, they experience Jax making her way through her mother's illness and passing, railing against it, dealing with the aftermath associated with such a loss, eventually accepting it, and using it as a driving force to continue to create.\n\nJax broke the EP down in one simple thought:\n\n\"Small Victories comes from the idea that doing anything creative in life takes a lot of persistence, struggle, and hustle. It's easy to expect that the spoils will come easily and be immediately fruitful. But if you focus on the little things, the \"small victories\", you realize that it's those things that are the most rewarding. That's what keeps me going.\"\n\nThe lead single is the EP's first track, \"Find What You're Looking For\", which is Jax's interpretation of her mother's final words to her:\n\n\"Don't let this break you\".", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-12-03T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Flint Eastwood, Valley Hush and Air is the Arche 12/3/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/405860662947111/", "description": "Join us for the opening reception of Art Off the Wall, which will be held on Friday, December 4 at the 117 Gallery, in the Ann Arbor Art Center, in conjunction with downtown Ann Arbor\u2019s Midnight Madness!\n\nThis event is open to the public and will include food, drinks and live entertainment. \n\nJOIN US AND TAKE A UNIQUE PIECE OF ART OFF THE WALL!\n\nArt Off the Wall is the Ann Arbor Art Center's annual signature holiday art exhibition.

The story of the Rouse Simmons is a holiday remembrance of loss and renewal, love, and the resilience of the human spirit. The ship's captain, Herman Schuenemann, was well-known and loved on the Chicago River docks where he sold (and sometimes gave away) the trees brought down from Manistique. The ship was lost in Lake Michigan in November 1912, but the captain's wife and family kept up this tradition for 22 years more, well beyond the days of the tall ships on the Great Lakes. There were many Christmas tree ships on the Great Lakes, but the Rouse Simmons is famed for her family. Numerous books, children's stories, and museum exhibits have kept this story alive. Lee wrote and recorded his song about her in 1989, and has presented an annual concert ever since to remember this story and many other songs and stories about family ties, and the holiday season, against a backdrop of mariners and Michigan history.\nwww.LeeMurdock.com", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-12-04T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Lee Murdock's Christmas Ship Concert with Blue Horizon Band"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1050406465015551/", "description": "Join us as we celebrate five years of great beer at 2019 W.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1088535237838163/", "description": "\"Lush, introspective, elegant\"\u2014Boston Globe.

The saxophonist was embraced by the jazz mainstream on the release of 1994\u2019s Moodswing, and he\u2019s been both a critical and commercial favorite ever since. The Bad Plus, by contrast, have courted controversy since the release of their 2003 major label debut, These Are the Vistas. But when Joshua Redman joined the idiosyncratic trio as a special guest a few years back, a brilliant collaboration was born.
