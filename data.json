Autumnal aromas of crisp apple and earthy wet leaves mingle with sweet-tart sour cherry. Rich, vinous wet tobacco and juicy fruits on the palate are complemented by subtle chocolate and caramel notes and balanced by lactic acidity, tart green apple and dry tannins that persist through a long and slightly mineral finish.\n\nFramboise 2015 - Our take on this classic style is neither spontaneously fermented nor barrel aged, but the addition of lactic acid and raspberries to our crisp Blonde create a flavor that is refreshingly tart without being aggressively sour or acidic. A crisp and refreshing brew with tart raspberry, and subtle notes of zesty orange peel and spicy coriander.\n\nAnniversary Barleywine 2015 - Our 20th anniversary ale combines the best of all worlds \u2013 big, rich malts with plenty of nutty and caramel sweetness; the bitterness of a heavy-handed dose of resiny locally grown hops; and the warming alcohols you would expect in a high gravity brew. An American Barleywine brewed with predominantly Thomas Fawcett malts and Michigan-grown Chinook hops. We brewed this bad boy in honor of our 20th anniversary because a big celebration demanded a big beer! And since running a brewery is sometimes sweet and sometimes sour, we decided to pull off a portion of the beer to sour in our cellar... \n\nAnniversary Sour Barleywine 2015 - We like our sour beers big and rich, and sometimes even bitter so our hoppy anniversary barleywine was the perfect base beer for this special celebration ale. Floral, woodsy and hoppy aromas leads into an incredibly complex palate with toffee and caramel, a hint of sweet tart pineapple, notes of charred wood, sweet citrus and tangy grapefruit fading into a long and bracingly bitter finish.\n\nAll selections are only available at the Brewpub.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/513930525454429/", "name": "Drink me now or lay me down, a sale of cellar bottles"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-11-27T19:30:00-05:00", "description": "This original holiday romp is inspired by the British tradition of Pantomime (or Panto) - which is like a crazy mash up between a musical comedy, a vaudeville act, an old-fashioned melodrama and a parade - a truly raucous evening's entertainment.

Flint Eastwood is what happens when friends and family gather in the forgotten spaces of an embattled city and are left to create with no rules, no boundaries, and nothing holding them back. Jax's endless creativity is a byproduct of growing up in a talented family.\n\nHer father was one of ten kids, each of whom played guitar and sang. Her oldest brother, Sam, played in punk bands, and Jax spent her teenage years learning the value of passion and acceptance at DIY shows. As she got older, her other brother (and Flint Eastwood collaborator and producer) Seth started playing in bands throughout the Detroit garage rock scene. Their dad worked as a curb address painter to pay the bills once the housing crash made his job as a mortgage broker invalid. During this time, Jax and her brothers went door to door, passing out flyers advertising her father's services, through some of the toughest residential neighborhoods in Detroit. These struggles helped form the vision that drives Flint Eastwood: to give everyone listening (whether live or on record) a momentary escape from the problems we all have.\n\nBetween helping around the house, Jax spent her days in her family's Detroit-area home, without cable and internet, teaching herself to play her father's 12-string Taylor guitar that he left for them in the living room. It was also during this time that her mother's love for Motown music began to influence Jax's knack for the theatrics and power of the Detroit sound, as Mom played records from The Temptations, the Jackson Five, and Earth Wind & Fire.\n\nOnce old enough to break out on her own, Jax briefly moved to a small German tourist town in rural Georgia, where the only station in town played solely pop and country. There, she fell in love with the hooks and harmonies that define American pop music. Later, she moved with Seth to Los Angeles, to mainly focus on writing for licensing opportunities and playing small clubs and house parties around town. While in LA, Jax developed a love for film, hopping on tour with bands every chance she could get as a self-taught videographer. Her experiences on the West Coast still influence Jax's push to make her musical endeavors into well-rounded multimedia presentations (mixing music with theatrical lighting, video projection, and costumes).\n\nUpon returning home to Detroit at the very beginning of the much-maligned city's recent resurgence, Jax's explosive and endearing personality on stage became the driving force behind Flint Eastwood. But through it all, it was the songs that were always the focus.\n\nOn their now sold-out debut EP Late Nights In Bolo Ties (2013), Jax and her friends mixed elements of pulsing electronic tracks with blistering bluesy guitar licks, all with a spaghetti-western backdrop, inspired by Sunday night movie sessions with Jax and her father.\n\nOn the forthcoming EP, Small Victories (to be released October 23), Jax has returned to her Detroit roots, mixing a taste of the theatricality of Motown music with her more recently found love for pop music. The result is six songs full of hooks. The type of tracks that you turn up a little too loud, close your eyes, and forget where you are for four minutes. In a live setting, the songs are taken to another level entirely, mixing a CHVRCHES-like depth with a twenty | one | pilots-style flair for the dramatic. This approach has led the band to rapidly gain an ever-growing fanbase. Their last two hometown headline plays have sold out (400+ tickets per show), and the band has toured heavily through the Midwest, mixing festival looks like Electric Forest, MoPop Festival, and Midpoint Music Festival with club appearances alongside acts such as Foxy Shazam, Mayer Hawthorne, Betty Who, X Ambassadors, and Andrew WK.\n\nSmall Victories was crafted and polished in Detroit\u2019s second oldest church, now repurposed as Assemble Sound, a hub of Detroit creativity that fosters artists through collaboration. In this crumbling but inspiring location, the new record was created as a coping mechanism to help Jax deal with the loss of her mother, who was her biggest fan and inspiration. As the listener makes their way through the EP, they experience Jax making her way through her mother's illness and passing, railing against it, dealing with the aftermath associated with such a loss, eventually accepting it, and using it as a driving force to continue to create.\n\nJax broke the EP down in one simple thought:\n\n\"Small Victories comes from the idea that doing anything creative in life takes a lot of persistence, struggle, and hustle. It's easy to expect that the spoils will come easily and be immediately fruitful. But if you focus on the little things, the \"small victories\", you realize that it's those things that are the most rewarding. That's what keeps me going.\"\n\nThe lead single is the EP's first track, \"Find What You're Looking For\", which is Jax's interpretation of her mother's final words to her:\n\n\"Don't let this break you\".", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1643528942585214/", "name": "Flint Eastwood, Valley Hush and Air is the Arche 12/3/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-12-04T18:00:00-05:00", "description": "Join us for the opening reception of Art Off the Wall, which will be held on Friday, December 4 at the 117 Gallery, in the Ann Arbor Art Center, in conjunction with downtown Ann Arbor\u2019s Midnight Madness!\n\nThis event is open to the public and will include food, drinks and live entertainment. \n\nJOIN US AND TAKE A UNIQUE PIECE OF ART OFF THE WALL!\n\nArt Off the Wall is the Ann Arbor Art Center's annual signature holiday art exhibition.

The story of the Rouse Simmons is a holiday remembrance of loss and renewal, love, and the resilience of the human spirit. The ship's captain, Herman Schuenemann, was well-known and loved on the Chicago River docks where he sold (and sometimes gave away) the trees brought down from Manistique. The ship was lost in Lake Michigan in November 1912, but the captain's wife and family kept up this tradition for 22 years more, well beyond the days of the tall ships on the Great Lakes. There were many Christmas tree ships on the Great Lakes, but the Rouse Simmons is famed for her family. Numerous books, children's stories, and museum exhibits have kept this story alive. Lee wrote and recorded his song about her in 1989, and has presented an annual concert ever since to remember this story and many other songs and stories about family ties, and the holiday season, against a backdrop of mariners and Michigan history.\nwww.LeeMurdock.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1141520755876717/", "name": "Lee Murdock's Christmas Ship Concert with Blue Horizon Band"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-12-05T00:00:00-05:00", "description": "Join ABC in our effort to warm the feet of each child and adult in need of new, warm socks this winter.\n\nWe are asking for new, warm socks this season as part of our terminate hunger partnerships with the St. Andrew\u2019s Breakfast Program.\n\nEach donor will be recognized by their own \u201csock\u201d hung in the pub with care during the holiday season and receive your choice of a coupons:\nBOGO 1/2 off meals or 1/2 off any draft beer. \nBegining November 25th through December 23rd.\n\nAny questions, please contact beth@arborbrewing.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/147591712264416/", "name": "Holiday Sock Drive"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2015-12-05T18:00:00-05:00", "description": "Join us as we celebrate five years of great beer at 2019 W.

Barrett recalls, \"In 1985, I was visiting a friend in New York City who was a writer for Sports Illustrated.

January 16 | 9pm | 18+ | $14 Cover\n\nChrome Sparks is the solo project of Jeremy Malvin, a Brooklyn transplant from Pittsburgh by way of Ann Arbor. In 2014, after having self released a small handful of singles and two EPs on Bandcamp, Malvin signed to the taste making Sydney based label Future Classic. Under the new label, he rereleased Sparks EP and released the Goddess EP. His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/769930223136488/", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-21T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "\"Lush, introspective, elegant\"\u2014Boston Globe.

The saxophonist was embraced by the jazz mainstream on the release of 1994\u2019s Moodswing, and he\u2019s been both a critical and commercial favorite ever since. The Bad Plus, by contrast, have courted controversy since the release of their 2003 major label debut, These Are the Vistas. But when Joshua Redman joined the idiosyncratic trio as a special guest a few years back, a brilliant collaboration was born. Redman\u2019s melodic prowess blends seamlessly with the \u201cavant-garde populism\u201d of The Bad Plus, pushing the boundaries of jazz beyond all imagination. Metroland describes this new all-star quartet best: \u201cIt\u2019s as though Redman is the long-lost fourth member of the group, just waiting to be snapped snugly into place.\u201d \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/the-bad-plus-joshua-redman", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1589849627952742/", "name": "The Bad Plus Joshua Redman"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "New music from an expat Australian trio", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/831801416940807/", "name": "The Waifs"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-28T20:30:00-04:00", "description": "This original holiday romp is inspired by the British tradition of Pantomime (or Panto) - which is like a crazy mash up between a musical comedy, a vaudeville act, an old-fashioned melodrama and a parade - a truly raucous evening's entertainment.
