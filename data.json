She calls herself Julie, says she\u2019s from California, and slips back to a rented room at night. From an anonymous internet caf\u00e9, she checks the website of her hometown paper.  Back in Garland, Tennessee, two young men are about to be paroled.   Both have served time for a crime about which Grace knows a great deal.   Their daring escapade  went bad, but not before Grace made it onto a plane \u2014 contraband in her carry-on \u2014  and began methodically  disassembling the known facts of her life.  Now she knows that somehow, a piece of her past will find her. As the story  unfolds, taking us from small-town USA to the heights and depths of the art scene in New York and Europe, we learn who Grace has been: a girl with a messy, broken home life and a knack for making herself loveable\u2013 until she comes face to face with what she actually wants, and everything falls apart.   And so begins a cat-and-mouse waiting game, a tale of lies and deception, desperate stakes and dual identities.\n\nMesmerizing, atmospheric, and psychologically nuanced, Unbecoming reinvents the heist plot and takes up the making of a femme fatale\u2014this time, from a woman\u2019s point of view.\n\n\u201cFrom the first page, you know Rebecca Scherm is the real thing.

In 2014, after having self released a small handful of singles and two EPs on Bandcamp, Malvin signed to the taste making Sydney based label Future Classic. Under the new label, he rereleased Sparks EP and released the Goddess EP. His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers. FADER has described his music as \u2018form-shifting beats [that] seem to resonate with spaced-out chillers and hyperactive party kids alike\u2019.\n\nIn 2012, while on Warped Tour as the drummer for Stepdad, Malvin released the slow burning, bass heavy single \u201cMarijuana\u201d on a Bandcamp compilation highlighting music from he and his friends in Ann Arbor. It quickly rocketed to #1 on Hype Machine and has since become an internet-stoner anthem. It has subsequently been rereleased by Future Classic and Kitsun\u00e9.\n\nHis upcoming release, Parallelism, was made using sounds from three analog synthesizers, vocal samples from friends, and a tambourine.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/578", "name": "Chrome Sparks 1/16/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1390235697944662/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-01-17T20:00:00-05:00", "description": "Every Sunday Aventura is La Familia Industry Night because when you work in the industry we are all family.

January 23 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nMatthew Dear - Depending on whom you ask, Matthew Dear is a DJ, a dance-music producer, an experimental pop artist, a bandleader. He co-founded both Ghostly International and its dancefloor offshoot, Spectral Sound. He\u2019s had remixes commissioned by The XX, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Spoon, Hot Chip, The Postal Service, and Chemical Brothers; He\u2019s made mixes for Get Physicals Body Language and Fabric mix series. He maintains four aliases (Audion, False, Jabberjaw, and Matthew Dear), each with its own style and distinct visual identity. He straddles multiple musical worlds and belongs to none and he\u2019s just hitting his stride.\n\nMatthew Dear\u2019s 2003 full-length debut, Leave Luck to Heaven, is a suite of sparse, wickedly funky house laced with Dear\u2019s deep, distinctive vocals, and includes the much-loved single Dog Days (voted one of Pitchforks Top 100 Songs of the Decade). The record was met with rapturous acclaim from both the dance-music establishment and the critical press, including a four-star review in Rolling Stone. The 2007 follow-up, Asa Breed, is a considerable departure from Heavens dancefloor excursions, incorporating the polyrhythms of Afrobeat, the irreverent pop sensibilities of Brian Eno, and the austere beauty of Krautrock. More four-stars reviews followed, and Dear subsequently began touring with a live three-piece band, Matthew Dear\u2019s Big Hands, in which Dear acted as frontman, commanding the stage with a Bryan Ferry-like swagger and a gentlemans grace.\n\n2010 saw the release of Dear\u2019s watershed third album, Black City, a darkly playful sound-world that envelops the listener like the arms of a malevolent lover. Black City was met with near-unanimous critical praise, earning top marks from Mojo, Uncut, Q, URB, and the Village Voice, ending up on countless year-end lists, and earning Pitchfork\u2019s coveted Best New Music nod. A worldwide tour followed, in which Dear and a newly expanded band continued to hone their live chops with vicious focus.\n\nMatthew Dear\u2019s latest full-length, 2012\u2019s Beams, is both a drastic departure from and worthy successor to Black City\u2019s gothic masterwork. A suite of weird, wild, and queasily optimistic rhythm-driven pop songs, Beams is the latest chapter in the continuing evolution of one of music\u2019s most fascinating minds. After over a decade of exploring pops outer limits, Matthew Dear now inhabits a rarified corner of the musical universe: no longer tethered to any one genre, respected by his peers, and blessed with a bottomless well of creative energy. Now is Matthew Dear\u2019s moment, and it sounds like nothing else.\n\nOn stage, Matthew Dear performs with a multi-pieced live band, unraveling the tightly wound album tracks into kaleidoscopic walls of sound.

Yet, if you do not know her name, it\u2019s likely because she has spent the past 20 years as a backup singer for the Rolling Stones, Sting, Chris Botti, and countless others. Her name may not be on the marquee, but she doesn\u2019t care. Her astonishing range, spot-on intonation, mastery of the stage, and infectious sweet smile make her the go-to singer for the likes of Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Beyonc\u00e9, Bobby McFerrin, Lou Reed, Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin, and a host of others. As one of the top session and backup singers, she\u2019s featured in the Oscar-winning documentary 20 Feet from Stardom and celebrated for her live concert duets with Mick Jagger during \u201cGimme Shelter\u201d that have also received millions of hits on YouTube. After winning Grammy Awards for \u201cBest Female R&B Performance\u201d (1992) and \u201cBest Music Film\u201d (2015), she has decided to move forward from being a backup singer, putting together her own band and claiming her well-deserved place center stage. \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/ms-lisa-fischer-and-grand-baton", "name": "Ms. Lisa Fischer and Grand Baton", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1020565857968750/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-01-29T21:30:00-05:00", "description": "Friday, January 29 | 9:30pm | 18+ | $12 adv./ $14 day of\n\nProtomartyr (https://www.facebook.com/protomartyr)\nwith: Rebel Kind & Deadbeat Beat\n\nShow info: http://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/591", "name": "Protomartyr w/ Rebel Kind & Deadbeat Beat 1/29/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1070813002942671/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-02-02T19:30:00-05:00", "description": "Tuesday, February 2, 2016, 7:30 pm\nLydia Mendelssohn Theatre\n\nWith Tanya Tagaq, ancient meets modern in provocative, powerful ways.

March 5 | 9pm | $15 Cover | 18+\n\nElectric Six -  Mortality. It\u2019s the primary reason we don\u2019t live forever. If not for our mortality, the number of years each of us would have to roam this earth would be as infinite as the sands of time running through the earth itself. When extraterrestrials eventually make first contact with us within the next twenty years, the first glaringly obvious thing they will notice\u2026is that we die. They will come to our planet with sinister intentions and they will immediately have the upper hand because we die\u2026and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a simple as that. And it\u2019s all because of our mortality.\n\nWhile aliens (and the government!!!!!) will always be there to kill us, we have for generations used our cold dead hands to clutch onto whatever silver lining we could sew into the dark cloud of our everlasting mortality. Specifically, we tell ourselves that we can live forever, not in corporeal form, but through our creations of art\u2026and our expressions of love.\n\nThusly, art and love are more important than ever, because they are now the conduits that preserve our life forces. If you don\u2019t create art and you don\u2019t love nobody\u2026well then, you will be forgotten, rather quickly. No one wants to be forgotten rather quickly. No one more so\u2026than Electric Six.\n\nElectric Six understands all this stuff as it prepares to unveil its eleventh studio album Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, which will be released on October 6 on Metropolis Records. The album is steeped in themes of mortality, death, discorporation and discoloration\u2026all while it tries to convince you it is actually a work of art, a labour of love.\n\nFrom the pounding, driving opener, \u201cDrone Strikes\u201d, through the 1970s guitar anthem \u201cTwo Dollar Two\u201d, Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die! reveals that Electric Six knows that it is going to die, but will not go out quietly. From there, the album moves through the pop goodness of \u201cKids Are Evil\u201d and \u201cA Variation of Elaine\u201d, the prog-rock showmanship of \u201cSlow Motion Man\u201d, and even a tribute to Elvis Presley in his more rotund years with \u201cDime Dime Penny Dime\u201d.\n\n\u201cBig Red Arthur\u201d is the anchor track of the album, as it emits a rock-opera bombast that is reminiscent of Radiohead sodomizing David Bowie in the center of his mind. It, like most of the songs on this record, is about death\u2026but it\u2019s kind of funny because it\u2019s only about the death of a fake, out-of-shape drunk Santa Claus who is too fucking stupid to make it down the chimney correctly. In this case, we just end up laughing at death. And that\u2019s uplifting.\n\nTo summarize, mortality is everywhere, and this fall, thanks to their new record Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, Electric Six will be everywhere too. Everybody gonna die someday, but with Electric Six\u2019s new album, you no longer have to worry about any of it. Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die is Electric Six\u2019s brand new record for 2015 and it is available on Metropolis Records on Oct. 2. You can come see Electric Six play in your town on the I Wanna Lick The Screen tour, starting in their home state of Michigan on Sept. 25.", "name": "Electric Six 3/5/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/998925893483957/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-03-08T21:00:00-05:00", "description": "Tue.

He has returned home to the Bay Area after living in Los Angeles these past three years, and is self-producing his new album with help from friends in Berkeley and San Francisco. The Zombie Dinosaur LP revisits the satirical, funny, uptempo style of Lars\u2019 2004 debut album, the Laptop EP. It features guest appearances by Watsky, Kool Keith, and Less than Jake\u2019s Roger Lima. Zombie Dinosaur tackles such topics as postfeminism, in a nod to Game of Thrones (\u201cDragon Blood\u201d); disappointing reunion bands with very few of their original members (\u201cSublime with Rome is Not the Same thing as Sublime\u201d); hipster parenting (\u201cHipster Mom\u201d); and the current state of EDM (\u201cSigning Dubstep\u201d). The project was funded entirely by Lars\u2019s third highly successful Kickstarter campaign, through which he raised over $42k to create and release Zombie Dinosaur under his own label, Horris Records. In the ten years that have followed his debut release, the Laptop EP, Lars has independently produced and released three other solo full-length albums, four EPs, and a number of mixtapes. He has collaborated with KRS-One, mentored and helped develop the career of fellow Stanford alum K.Flay (with whom he collaborated on the 2009 Single and Famous EP), opened for Nas and Snoop Dogg, and played multiple summers on the Vans Warped Tour. He has also headlined club shows across the US and in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Lars has spoken and presented at two different TEDx conferences, performed at Carnegie Hall with a live string section (at Scholastic\u2019s 2012 Art and Writing Awards \u2013 where he debuted the video for his song, \u201cFlow Like Poe,\u201d which is the lead single on his 2012 Edgar Allan Poe EP). Lars has developed and grown Horris Records in this past decade, signing the label\u2019s first artist, Weerd Science (the solo hip-hop project of Cohered & Cambria\u2019s drummer, Josh Eppard). Lars has continued to produce music videos for himself and his friends, including a cameo credit on past musical collaborator \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic\u2019s 2014 \u201cLame Claim to Fame\u201d (for which Lars was given a special shout out in the liner notes to Al\u2019s Grammy Award winning album, Mandatory Fun). Having been labeled as one of the pioneers of the underground \u201cnerdcore hip-hop\u201d subgenre, Lars has recently expanded from the studio to the classroom. With visiting scholar/teacher residencies at USC, and in the UK, and across the US in Nantucket, Florida, California, Alaska, and Kansas, Lars has found joy in educating young people about \u201clit-hop,\u201d a subject term he coined to highlight the connections between literature, classical poetry, and the cultural history of rap. Lars has continued to work closely with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, teaching workshops on preventing self-harm, and positive ways to use music as creative therapy for depression. He has also worked with the American Heart Association, promoting youth heart health. It\u2019s been quite a decade.

We hadn\u2019t really thought a whole lot about the session in advance\u2014on tour, your default response to things is \u201clet\u2019s just show up and play\u201d\u2014and we were kind of under the gun time-wise when we got to the club. So we decided to just do it quick and dirty, old-school style. Like the open mic nights I used to play: unamplified guitar and vocals, friends with their axes playing along, arrangements arrived at on the fly and infinitely flexible. Four songs later we felt really inspired\u2014me and Matt played a song or two without anybody else around because we\u2019d gotten down to the basement before the others, the total song choice was strictly \u201cwhat do you figure we should play now?\u201d, the mood was relaxed and free\u2026we loved it. Later that night, we decided to strip down the drum kit to essentials and play a choke-the-motor set echoing and elaborating on what we\u2019d done downstairs: a sort of small-ensemble feel, lower in volume but actually higher in intensity. Like what we do in concentrate. It was one of our two favorite performances of the year, the other being the second night at the Fillmore. It felt like acres of new terrain opening up atop an ancient foundation. As soon as it was over, we all wanted to do it again. So in 2016 we\u2019re taking that set on the road. Not that exact set, obviously; the particulars will vary from night to night. But smaller rooms, audible frequencies, up close and personal: this is the general plan. Making eye contact with people in the back row, being able to go off-mic when I want to and still be heard. Total visibility. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this tour. I love the big album release shows as much as anybody, but that City Winery feel of just playing together with bare essentials in close quarters\u2026there\u2019s nothing like it, and when the whole room locks onto the signal, it\u2019s really special.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/581", "name": "The Mountain Goats 4/8/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/554988117991170/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-09T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "\"Look no farther to find a new pairing to be jealous of.\"\u2014Matt Mansfield, Z93 FM, Grand Rapids", "name": "The Accidentals", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/495921443927297/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-11T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "A unique engima from Bermuda", "name": "Heather Nova", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513669432294818/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-13T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "South Africa's legendary breaker of walls", "name": "The Johnny Clegg Band", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1602568673339827/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-14T19:30:00-04:00", "description": "Thursday, April 14, 2016, 7:30 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\nNamed after a pub in Austria, where the former Vienna Conservatory students spent many a night socializing and performing at a monthly open mic, Mnozil Brass beautifully combines fearless, world-class virtuosity and zany theatrical wit.

Zafir explores the commonalities of music born in the cultural centers of Iraq and Syria that blew like the wind (zafir) across the waters of the Mediterranean to Al-Andalus, where it blended with elements of Spanish music, then was brought back across the seas to North Africa, where it flourished in the cities of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Zafir features virtuoso composer and musical director Simon Shaheen with his group Qantara, acclaimed Tunisian singer Sonia M\u2019barek, flamenco musician Juan P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez, and the fiery young flamenco dancer Auxi Fernandez, who completes the music with her explosive footwork. \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/zafir-simon-shaheen/", "name": "Zafir: Musical Winds from North Africa to Andaluc\u00eda", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/419604171550681/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Legendary guitar mastery", "name": "Leo Kottke", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1512513839062559/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-16T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Saturday, April 16, 2016, 8:00 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\nOf the three major orchestras based in Munich, the Bavarian Radio Orchestra is the most prominent, with a string of eminent music directors including Rafael Kubelik, Sir Colin Davis, Lorin Maazel, and, since 2003, Mariss Jansons.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/769930223136488/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-23T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Saturday, April 23, 2016, 8:00 pm\nMichigan Theater \n\nOn paper, the partnership of Joshua Redman and the Bad Plus seems unlikely. The saxophonist was embraced by the jazz mainstream on the release of 1994\u2019s Moodswing, and he\u2019s been both a critical and commercial favorite ever since. The Bad Plus, by contrast, have courted controversy since the release of their 2003 major label debut, These Are the Vistas. But when Joshua Redman joined the idiosyncratic trio as a special guest a few years back, a brilliant collaboration was born. Redman\u2019s melodic prowess blends seamlessly with the \u201cavant-garde populism\u201d of The Bad Plus, pushing the boundaries of jazz beyond all imagination. Metroland describes this new all-star quartet best: \u201cIt\u2019s as though Redman is the long-lost fourth member of the group, just waiting to be snapped snugly into place.\u201d \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/the-bad-plus-joshua-redman", "name": "The Bad Plus Joshua Redman", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1589849627952742/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-27T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "New music from an expat Australian trio", "name": "The Waifs", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/831801416940807/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-04-27T21:00:00-04:00", "description": "Wed.
