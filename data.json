The first decade was full of hope for a new social order.

They advocated for a utilitarian art that spoke to the masses and their revolutionary aesthetic can still be seen in advertisements and other materials made for the public eye today. Among their most provocative and visionary works were posters advertising Soviet films.

She calls herself Julie, says she\u2019s from California, and slips back to a rented room at night. From an anonymous internet caf\u00e9, she checks the website of her hometown paper.  Back in Garland, Tennessee, two young men are about to be paroled.   Both have served time for a crime about which Grace knows a great deal.   Their daring escapade  went bad, but not before Grace made it onto a plane \u2014 contraband in her carry-on \u2014  and began methodically  disassembling the known facts of her life.  Now she knows that somehow, a piece of her past will find her. As the story  unfolds, taking us from small-town USA to the heights and depths of the art scene in New York and Europe, we learn who Grace has been: a girl with a messy, broken home life and a knack for making herself loveable\u2013 until she comes face to face with what she actually wants, and everything falls apart.   And so begins a cat-and-mouse waiting game, a tale of lies and deception, desperate stakes and dual identities.\n\nMesmerizing, atmospheric, and psychologically nuanced, Unbecoming reinvents the heist plot and takes up the making of a femme fatale\u2014this time, from a woman\u2019s point of view.\n\n\u201cFrom the first page, you know Rebecca Scherm is the real thing. Unbecoming is an assured exploration of the intricate, intense, risky processes that go into creating identity\u2014and into dismantling it.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tana French\n\n\u201cRebecca Scherm\u2019s extraordinarily confident voice and style, this novel\u2019s depth of detail\u2014great characters and a terrifically engaging plot\u2014are a sheer delight to read. There is something very fresh and captivating about this book, and best of all I had no idea what was going to happen from one page to the next.\u201d\n\n\u2014Kate Atkinson\n\n\u201cSome characters who go bad find that it\u2019s against their nature, and some who go bad discover that dishonesty is the central truth about themselves. Rebecca Scherm\u2019s wonderful novel Unbecoming has a mesmerizing narrator, Grace, who discovers that her gift (and it is a real gift) is for deceit. A thriller, a psychological study, and a love story, this novel is an unusually intelligent and suspenseful book. The dark arts have rarely been so brightly lit.\u201d\n\n\u2014Charles Baxter\n\nRebecca Scherm is the author of Unbecoming, a novel.

January 16 | 9pm | 18+ | $14 Cover\n\nChrome Sparks is the solo project of Jeremy Malvin, a Brooklyn transplant from Pittsburgh by way of Ann Arbor. In 2014, after having self released a small handful of singles and two EPs on Bandcamp, Malvin signed to the taste making Sydney based label Future Classic. Under the new label, he rereleased Sparks EP and released the Goddess EP. His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers. FADER has described his music as \u2018form-shifting beats [that] seem to resonate with spaced-out chillers and hyperactive party kids alike\u2019.\n\nIn 2012, while on Warped Tour as the drummer for Stepdad, Malvin released the slow burning, bass heavy single \u201cMarijuana\u201d on a Bandcamp compilation highlighting music from he and his friends in Ann Arbor. It quickly rocketed to #1 on Hype Machine and has since become an internet-stoner anthem. It has subsequently been rereleased by Future Classic and Kitsun\u00e9.\n\nHis upcoming release, Parallelism, was made using sounds from three analog synthesizers, vocal samples from friends, and a tambourine.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/578", "name": "Chrome Sparks 1/16/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-01-16T21:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1390235697944662/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Join ABC in our effort to warm the feet of each child and adult in need of new, warm socks this winter.\n\nWe are asking for new, warm socks this season as part of our terminate hunger partnerships with the St. Andrew\u2019s Breakfast Program.\n\nEach donor will be recognized by their own \u201csock\u201d hung in the pub with care during the holiday season and receive your choice of a coupons:\nBOGO 1/2 off meals or 1/2 off any draft beer. \nBegining November 25th through December 23rd.\n\nAny questions, please contact beth@arborbrewing.com", "name": "Holiday Sock Drive", "date": "2016-01-19T00:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/147591712264416/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Wednesday, January 20, 2016, 7:30 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\n\u201cThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis is so far from the usual big-band clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d (Dallas) Since 1988, Wynton Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/769930223136488/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "\"Lush, introspective, elegant\"\u2014Boston Globe.
