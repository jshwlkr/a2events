[{"description": "This event takes place at the Michigan Theater, 603 E Liberty St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104.\n\t\nCelebrated for a visual language that brings together unexpected materials and radically unconventional techniques, artist Julian Schnabel has been a pioneering, and controversial, figure since his first solo exhibition in 1979. As part of a group of 1980s artists known as Neo-Expressionists (a term that he would reject), Schnabel wanted to return to painting pre-abstraction, and forged a practice that encompassed figuration, personal narratives, and references to history and mythology.  His paintings, sculptures, and works on paper have been the subject of numerous exhibitions at museums worldwide, including the current exhibition of his work at the University of Michigan Museum of Art (on view through September 27). Also a renowned filmmaker, in 1996 Schnabel wrote and directed the feature film Basquiat about artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, produced by Peter Brant. Brant Publications, Inc., is a leading art publisher whose titles include Art in America and Interview, among other important art magazines. Mr. Brant is also an entrepreneur, manufacturing executive, philanthropist, sportsman, and art collector who has a personal passion for contemporary art.\n\t\nThe exhibition Julian Schnabel was organized by the Brant Foundation Art Study Center.  Lead support for UMMA\u2019s installation is provided by Joseph and Annette Allen, the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the University of Michigan Health System, the Richard and Rosann Noel Endowment Fund, and Retirement Income Solutions.", "date": "2015-11-05T17:10:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1631299103808637/", "name": "UMMA & Penny W.

In a surprising style reminiscent of Maggie Nelson or Mark Doty, Frank examines a quintessential dish in each state, interweaving the culinary with personal and cultural associations of each region. From key lime pie (Florida) to elk stew (Montana), The Mad Feast commemorates the unexpected origins of the familiar. Brazenly dissecting the myriad intersections between history and food, Frank, in this gorgeously designed volume, considers politics, sexuality, violence, grief, and pleasure: the cool, creamy whoopie pie evokes toughness in the face of New England winters, while the stewlike perloo serves up an exploration of food and race in the South. Tracing an unpredictable map of our collective appetites, The Mad Feast presents a beguiling flavor profile of the American spirit.\n\nMatthew Gavin Frank has previously written about everything from wine-making in a tent in Italy to the social hierarchies of a pot farm in California.

Stadium Boulevard in Ann Arbor. \n \nThe City of Ann Arbor conducted a footing drain disconnection (FDD) program from 2003 through 2013 to reduce sanitary sewer basement backups in neighborhoods. The FDD program involved disconnecting footing drains from the city\u2019s sanitary sewer system and installing sump pumps to direct stormwater flows to the city\u2019s storm sewer system. \n\nIn 2013\u20132014, the city conducted a Sanitary Sewer Wet Weather Evaluation Project to determine the effectiveness of the FDD program in removing flows from the sanitary sewer system and reducing the risk of basement backups. The FDD program removed a large volume of stormwater from the sanitary sewer system. \n\nIn 2013, a survey showed that, while many residents are satisfied with their FDD installation, 40 percent reported increased anxiety about their sump pump and its operation. There were also reports of water or other problems in basements after the disconnection. As a result, the city has created a program to do two things:\n1.\tInvestigate and correct any footing drain disconnections or sump pump installations performed as part of the city\u2019s program that were not completed according to specifications or in accordance with common industry standards. \n2.\tProvide education for all sump pump owners on basic operations and maintenance of their sump pump installations. \nParticipants in the FDD program are encouraged to report issues with their sump pump installation or water in the basement to the city\u2019s consultants by Jan. 31, 2016, by calling 734.466.4480 or using the form online at www.a2gov.org/sumppumps.", "date": "2015-11-09T18:30:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/469118573249582/", "name": "Pump Operations and Maintenance Workshop"}, {"description": "After 18 years working at the City of Ann Arbor\u2019s Natural Area Preservation, Dea Armstrong will be leaving us at the end of the season.

Nov. 13 | 9pm | 18+ | $25 adv./ $30 day of\n\nVanessa Carlton\nwith: Joshua Hyslop\n\nAn unusual light shines through Liberman, Vanessa Carlton\u2019s fifth album. Its ten songs, built on ethereal melodies and lush orchestration, seem to climb out of the shadows, each resonating with a sense of haunting positivity.  The opening track, \u201cTake It Easy,\u201d instantly sets the tone, inviting the listener into a sort of sonic euphoria: each note and lyric thereafter builds on that aesthetic, creating an ongoing narrative that unfurls over its classic side A and side B. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a calm record,\u201d Carlton says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want any angst in there. I thought, \u2018What would I want to hear back? What would make me feel better in my darker times?\u2019 Even a phrase like \u2018take it easy,\u2019 which is in a million songs, brings happiness. This album leans toward seeing the good in humans and in the world.\u201d  \n\nCarlton began writing in the summer of 2012, beginning with \u201cUnlock The Lock,\u201d an evocative piano-driven track that set the tone for the songs to come. She\u2019d recently finished touring 2011\u2019s Rabbits On The Run, an album conceived through inspiration from Stephen Hawking\u2019s A Brief History of Time and Richard Adam\u2019s Watership Down. Carlton found herself in the desert and the song emerged, reflecting a newly revealing songwriting sensibility for the artist. \u201cI imagined a group of people listening to it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the first time I ever wanted to make something like s\u00e9ance music \u2013 something that would make a human brain feel at ease, something that would feel right in an everyday ritual. I also realized I wanted the record to be really soothing lyrically and not so much a reveal of me.\u201d\n\nThe musician followed that thread as she continued writing for the next year and a half, this time inspired by books like Joseph Campbell\u2019s The Power of Myth and Aldous Huxley\u2019s The Doors of Perception. Carlton\u2019s primary influence, however, was a colorful oil painting by her grandfather Alan J. Lee, who was originally named Liberman. The painting, created in 1963, hangs in Carlton\u2019s home and showcases three woman captured in swirling pastel colors. She wrote many songs while looking at the image, eventually deciding to call the album after her grandfather. \n\n\u201cThe swirly colors of that painting reminded me of the music and the music reminds me of those colors\u201d Carlton notes. \u201cThen I looked up what Liberman means and it\u2019s \u2018honorable man\u2019 and \u2018my beloved\u2019 \u2013 all these things that just felt right to me. It\u2019s a strong family name that, in a weird way, describes the music to me.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2013, Carlton gathered her songs and decamped to Real World Studio in Box, England to work with producer Steve Osborne, who\u2019d helmed Rabbits On The Run. In the studio, Carlton and Osborne focused on the sound, on creating layers of instrumentation with classic gear that veer away from crisp pop production and reference artists like Air. For Carlton, who began her career with several albums at the mercy of prescribed aesthetics, emphasizing the art of space and sonic beauty felt like the next step. This shift is revealed particularly in the trippy ambience of \u201cHouse of Seven Swords\u201d and the moody \u201cAscension,\u201d which builds a soundscape outward from the piano at its center. \n\nCarlton rounded out the album in Nashville, the city she now calls home, with producer Adam Landry who worked on three tracks. Carlton\u2019s husband, Deer Tick front man John McCauley, played on several songs throughout the process, including \u201cTake it Easy,\u201d \"Ascension\" and \u201cMatter of Time.\u201d The latter is stripped of instrumentation and highlights Carlton\u2019s voice as it soars over McCauley\u2019s delicately plucked electric guitar, reminiscent of the old school vocal recordings of Dusty Springfield.  As a whole, Liberman feels like a new chapter in Carlton\u2019s storied career, revealing new facets of her musical skill and instigating fresh inspirations. Stagnancy, she knows, is the antithesis to creativity. \n\n\u201cMartin Scorsese said sometimes your greatest challenge is not your failure but your success,\u201d Carlton says. \u201cIn a way I was able to persevere after having a success out of the gate and figure out a path that feels really pure to me. But I had to create this environment where I felt comfortable changing. When I was first doing records I was so young and I wanted to please everyone. But now I sort of feel ancient and I love it and I just want to make art for its own sake. Whether I fall on my face or not at least I know I did it. Everything I\u2019ve done and everything I am is there in the songs.\u201d", "date": "2015-11-13T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1651671698445679/", "name": "Vanessa Carlton 11/13/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Irving Stenn, Jr. Family Gallery\nMultipurpose Room\nFrom 11-1pm OR 2-4pm\n\nThis program is free and open to the public, but space is limited.

Bringing together like\u00adminded players and friends, he and his able\u00adminded Freaks crafted two separate albums of material, a low\u00adkey self\u00adtitled release in 2009 and a more full\u00adbodied 2013 record entitled How Far Away.\n\nAlex Bleeker and the Freaks\u2019 third album Country Agenda is the culmination of Bleeker\u2019s songwriting, as well as the gelling together of a fully formed band. With the full\u00adtime inclusion of guitarist Alex Steinberg, bassist Nick Lenchner, drummer Dylan Shumaker and keyboardist Jacob Wolf, along with occasional guest vocals from Mountain Man singer Molly Sarle, The Freaks\u2019 vibe has coalesced considerably.\n\nNo longer the work of a single director, this version of the band gives the songs more room to breathe, allowing the tunes to move in unexpected directions. A wholly collaborative effort, Country Agenda features multiple songwriters and ensemble playing that stretches out in unhurried passages of glowing musical interplay. The songs wander in slow motion like a coastline drive, drawing on the same wizened energy and brilliant restraint as Crazy Horse, the Dead, Moby Grape and other like\u00adminded cosmic travelers. Easily the most realized and best sounding set of tunes from the project, the strengths of the album are magnified by a cohesive feeling that was absent on previous Freaks records. The sound here is undeniably the birth of a solid band playing together, locked in the groove, and moving down the road in unison.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/502", "date": "2015-11-18T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/820090691422005/", "name": "Alex Bleeker & The Freaks 11/18/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Michigan Theater\n603 E Liberty St\nAnn Arbor, MI 48104\nPrem Krishnamurthy is a founding principal of the award-winning design studio Project Projects and the director/curator of the critically-acclaimed multidisciplinary exhibition space P!.

And performing tunes plucked from their lives, their community or from the canonical songbook that fed the Rev. Peyton\u2019s formative creative identity. It\u2019s a mix that\u2019s allowed the band to win fans from all corners of the Americana and rock worlds, and bring a new generation to blues and other forms of American roots music.\n\nSo Delicious is a perfect Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band album, with songs that speak from the heart and capture the trio \u2014 whose sound has been honed over 250 annual tour dates during the last eight years \u2014 playing at their peak. The charging, anthemic \u201cRaise a Little Hell,\u201d also the set\u2019s first video, lays out the band\u2019s live modus operandi, thriving on Bussell\u2019s and Breezy\u2019s chugging beat and the Rev.\u2019s resonator guitar riffs and mantra-like singing. The song was inspired by a show at a folk festival, where one of the promoters \u2014 struck by the Big Damn Band\u2019s raucous, juke joint power \u2014 told the Rev., \u201cY\u2019all sure raise a lot of hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Naw we don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201c the Rev. recalls. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe we do raise a little hell.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sweet, joyful \u201cPot Roast & Kisses,\u201d which the band has also committed to video, was written for Breezy. The Rev. was developing the finger-busting main riff after enjoying one of her pot roast dinners when the lyrics naturally fell into place. \u201cSome people don\u2019t believe that we really live the way we sing about in our songs,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut it\u2019s true. Breezy and me are together and really love each other.

Flint Eastwood is what happens when friends and family gather in the forgotten spaces of an embattled city and are left to create with no rules, no boundaries, and nothing holding them back. Jax's endless creativity is a byproduct of growing up in a talented family.\n\nHer father was one of ten kids, each of whom played guitar and sang. Her oldest brother, Sam, played in punk bands, and Jax spent her teenage years learning the value of passion and acceptance at DIY shows. As she got older, her other brother (and Flint Eastwood collaborator and producer) Seth started playing in bands throughout the Detroit garage rock scene. Their dad worked as a curb address painter to pay the bills once the housing crash made his job as a mortgage broker invalid. During this time, Jax and her brothers went door to door, passing out flyers advertising her father's services, through some of the toughest residential neighborhoods in Detroit. These struggles helped form the vision that drives Flint Eastwood: to give everyone listening (whether live or on record) a momentary escape from the problems we all have.\n\nBetween helping around the house, Jax spent her days in her family's Detroit-area home, without cable and internet, teaching herself to play her father's 12-string Taylor guitar that he left for them in the living room. It was also during this time that her mother's love for Motown music began to influence Jax's knack for the theatrics and power of the Detroit sound, as Mom played records from The Temptations, the Jackson Five, and Earth Wind & Fire.\n\nOnce old enough to break out on her own, Jax briefly moved to a small German tourist town in rural Georgia, where the only station in town played solely pop and country. There, she fell in love with the hooks and harmonies that define American pop music. Later, she moved with Seth to Los Angeles, to mainly focus on writing for licensing opportunities and playing small clubs and house parties around town. While in LA, Jax developed a love for film, hopping on tour with bands every chance she could get as a self-taught videographer. Her experiences on the West Coast still influence Jax's push to make her musical endeavors into well-rounded multimedia presentations (mixing music with theatrical lighting, video projection, and costumes).\n\nUpon returning home to Detroit at the very beginning of the much-maligned city's recent resurgence, Jax's explosive and endearing personality on stage became the driving force behind Flint Eastwood. But through it all, it was the songs that were always the focus.\n\nOn their now sold-out debut EP Late Nights In Bolo Ties (2013), Jax and her friends mixed elements of pulsing electronic tracks with blistering bluesy guitar licks, all with a spaghetti-western backdrop, inspired by Sunday night movie sessions with Jax and her father.\n\nOn the forthcoming EP, Small Victories (to be released October 23), Jax has returned to her Detroit roots, mixing a taste of the theatricality of Motown music with her more recently found love for pop music. The result is six songs full of hooks. The type of tracks that you turn up a little too loud, close your eyes, and forget where you are for four minutes. In a live setting, the songs are taken to another level entirely, mixing a CHVRCHES-like depth with a twenty | one | pilots-style flair for the dramatic. This approach has led the band to rapidly gain an ever-growing fanbase. Their last two hometown headline plays have sold out (400+ tickets per show), and the band has toured heavily through the Midwest, mixing festival looks like Electric Forest, MoPop Festival, and Midpoint Music Festival with club appearances alongside acts such as Foxy Shazam, Mayer Hawthorne, Betty Who, X Ambassadors, and Andrew WK.\n\nSmall Victories was crafted and polished in Detroit\u2019s second oldest church, now repurposed as Assemble Sound, a hub of Detroit creativity that fosters artists through collaboration. In this crumbling but inspiring location, the new record was created as a coping mechanism to help Jax deal with the loss of her mother, who was her biggest fan and inspiration. As the listener makes their way through the EP, they experience Jax making her way through her mother's illness and passing, railing against it, dealing with the aftermath associated with such a loss, eventually accepting it, and using it as a driving force to continue to create.\n\nJax broke the EP down in one simple thought:\n\n\"Small Victories comes from the idea that doing anything creative in life takes a lot of persistence, struggle, and hustle. It's easy to expect that the spoils will come easily and be immediately fruitful. But if you focus on the little things, the \"small victories\", you realize that it's those things that are the most rewarding. That's what keeps me going.\"\n\nThe lead single is the EP's first track, \"Find What You're Looking For\", which is Jax's interpretation of her mother's final words to her:\n\n\"Don't let this break you\".", "date": "2015-12-03T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1643528942585214/", "name": "Flint Eastwood, Valley Hush and Air is the Arche 12/3/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "It\u2019s party time in the Main Street Area!
