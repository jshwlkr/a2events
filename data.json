While some may have leapt at the chance to be on The Voice, Chamuel was initially wary of the realities (no pun intended) of submitting to a reality television show \u2013 though she soon found herself happily on team Usher and taking home 2nd place. \n\u201cI went to the show looking for a teacher and it turned out Usher was looking for a student\u201d, says 28-year-old Chamuel. \u201cI was craving the challenges and rewards of being part of a top musical community, and I found that on The Voice.\u201d\nBy the time she took The Voice stage in 2013, Chamuel had spent the better part of a decade fronting the seven-piece Michigan rock band, Ella Riot (formerly My Dear Disco). In the band, Chamuel learned the artistry of performing by touring around the country 200 days a year, releasing several albums, and learning to drive a tour bus that ran on waste vegetable oil. Eventually the fuel ran out; Ella Riot parted ways in 2012 and Chamuel returned to Massachusetts in search of home and solitude.  \nConsidering all the emotion contained within it, \u201cFace the Fire\u201d came together at a breakneck pace. For three weeks, Chamuel and her collaborators, Tyler Duncan and Theo Katzman \u2013 college pals and My Dear Disco band members \u2013 holed up in Chamuel\u2019s home, building the album from musical nuggets each had brought to the sessions. The trio takes influence from several genres across the history of music \u2013 spanning from 80\u2019s pop (\u201cRock It\u201d) and melodic house (\u201cWeight of the World\u201d) to VHS-infused reggae (\u201cMoney\u201d).  The title track on the album is no exception \u2013 showcasing the convergence of Chamuel\u2019s vision and her collaborators ingenuity.  \u201cFace the Fire\u201d serves as a sort of pulsing mission statement, a vamping call to action that Chamuel relates to her own experience in harnessing musical passion. This track, which like the rest of the album, was recorded and produced in Chamuel and Duncan\u2019s home studios, features a tapestry of interlocking percussion, surf-punk bass tones, and a rousing call and answer between Chamuel and her choir.  \n\u201cThe imagery I get when singing the song is that I\u2019m in front of a big, camp-like fire. There are people all around, and I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re ghosts or strangers, but they chime in while I sing. It\u2019s almost a trance-like state \u2013 being pulled towards this fire. Everyone is being pulled towards it.\u201d\nhttp://www.michellechamuel.com \n\nAbsofacto\nAbsofacto is the solo moniker of Jonathan Visger, who is also the lead vocalist and songwriter for Hollow & Akimbo and Mason Proper, in addition to being the former bass player of Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.   \nAbsofacto\u2019s latest single \u201cDissolve\u201d was #1 on Hype Machine\u2019s non-remix charts immediately upon release. \u201cDissolve\u201d can be described as a well-executed burst of eclectic stylistic flair, enjoyably difficult to classify in its welcome mixture of nostalgic pop, electronica and hints of R&B. The impressive stylistic balance is reminiscent of artists like Gorillaz and Beck at their best and most stylistically intuitive \u2014 lofty comparisons but well-deserved comparisons in this case. \nhttp://www.absofacto.com\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/soniclunch \nhttp://www.facebook.com/soniclunch\nhttp://www.instagram.com/soniclunch \nhttp://www.soniclunch.com/ \nhttp://www.bankofannarbor.com/"}, {"date": "2015-06-25 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1596014640673070/", "name": "Ingrid Michaelson with special guests Jukebox The Ghost", "description": "PRICE: $30, $35, $40, $45\n\nPop | Singer-Songwriter\n\n*Performance ineligible for Festival Sampler pricing.\n\nThe world first fell in love with Ingrid Michaelson when her song \u201cThe Way I Am\u201d became the irresistible pop rock anthem of 2007.

One band stood out by hot-wiring that sound with the subversive energy of some American bands of the era and that band was Swervedriver. They had the liquid distortion of shoegaze combined with the cool swagger of H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Sonic Youth, and Dinosaur Jr - giving them a unique sound and attitude.\n\nRelocating from Oxford to London, guitarists Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge, bassist Adi Vines and drummer Graham Bonnar debuted with a series of landmark Creation Records EPs, Son of Mustang Ford, Rave Down, and Sandblasted. Their full-length debut, 1991's Raise, to this day is hailed by Pitchfork as an album full of \"muscular, scorching guitars\" that \"still bring the noise like nobody's business\" with Mojo stating that Son of Mustang Ford \"remains one of the most glorious tunes to emerge in the wake of the so-called grunge explosion of '89, matching Adam Franklin and Jim Hartridge's motorised guitar-weaving with a beguiling, below-the-line vocal melody and lyrics that celebrated the joy of wide-open American freeways.\"\n\nThe band toured the album extensively, including a lengthy US tour with Soundgarden that brought their wall of sound to thousands. However with both Bonnar and Vines leaving the band not long after, the 1992 EP Never Lose That Feeling looked like it might be Swervedriver's (albeit scorching) swan song. Then in late 1992, Franklin and Hartridge demoed a new tune \"Duress,\" recruited drummer Jez Hindmarsh and set about recording a second full-length albumMezcal Head with Alan Moulder (My Bloody Valentine/Led Zeppelin), which included their biggest singles \"Duel\" and \"Last Train To Satansville.\" Touring extensively again, this time with Smashing Pumpkins and Medicine and with new bass player Steve George onboard, their sound was further imprinted on people's minds.\n\nMore roadblocks came to be in their way though: highly revered third album Ejector Seat Reservation came out in 1995 but was never released or toured in the US and although the band returned strongly with their fourth full-length 1998's 99th Dream, the energy was dissipating and they imploded at the end of an Australian tour resolving to go on hiatus.\n\nGoing their separate ways - Franklin moved to the US and released solo albums with his band Bolts of Melody - no-one really knew if the band actually was on hiatus or had split entirely. Then came an announcement in late 2007 that they would be performing at the following year's Coachella and heading back out on the road. Originally reforming with Hindmarsh on drums followed briefly by the return of Bonnar, they finally settled on Mikey Jones of Heaven and Bolts of Melody and have continued touring and appearing at festivals internationally.\n\nIn 2013 everything was ratcheted up several notches when Swervedriver released its first single in 15 years, \"Deep Wound.\" Spin Magazine called it a \"warm, confidently roiling return\" with Mojo adding \"those same distorted pop sensibilities remain reassuringly intact\" and the band debuted the song on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" in the States.\n\nAnd finally the announcement comes that the band has been recording at legendary studios Birdland in Melbourne, and Konk in London. Their fifth album I Wasn't Born To Lose You is to be released worldwide in March of 2015. \n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/394"}, {"date": "2015-09-12 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/928346343899749/", "name": "Ellis Paul w/Mike Vial", "description": "New music from the quintessential New England songwriter.

Heck, even they\u2019d cop to a few, like Ricky Nelson and The Clash. But once those same RIYL tags have been filtered through the minds and hands and voices of this five-piece, there\u2019s simply nothing else like it.\n\nThe Growlers took the phrase \u201cBeach Goth\u201d as an apt descriptor of their music. Sunburned and salty, that term perfectly describes their distinctive melding of reverb heavy surf guitar and Bakersfield-style honky tonk with \u201880s post-punk.\n\nThis is especially true of Chinese Fountain, The Growlers\u2019 fifth full-length set to be released on September 23rd via Everloving Records. The 11 songs found on it are some of the strongest that they\u2019ve committed to tape yet; a byproduct not only of eight years in the trenches together, but finely honing their gypsy folk dirges and psychedelic sea shanties to fans at close to 150 shows each year. The connection between vocalist Brooks Nielsen and guitarist Matt Taylor (the principal songwriters of the group) has only grown deeper.\n\n\u201cThe band played better than they\u2019ve ever played,\u201d says Nielsen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the process down now. There\u2019s less screwing around to get the songs laid out and we weren\u2019t waiting around for take after take. We knew it and we played without much time to spare.\u201d\nThat confidence bleeds through every track on Chinese Fountain, with the band assured enough to layer in shades of many new influences: the loping ska beat of \u201cDull Boy\u201d and \u201cGoing Gets Tuff,\u201d the playful disco beat behind the title track, or the Teardrop Explodes-like agitation of \u201cGood Advice.\u201d\n\nNot that the band left themselves much room to second-guess anything. The five spent about three weeks writing the tracks, and about half that time in the studio recording them. That may sound rushed, but it\u2019s not as if you can hear any strain on the finished product; Chinese Fountain is as rock solid and watertight as anything in their still-growing discography.\n\nThere\u2019s evolution to be heard in Chinese Fountain as well, courtesy of some of Nielsen\u2019s most pointed and poignant lyrics to date. He takes our obsession with the online world to task on the funky title track. When he drops the bomb that obliterates that most famous of Beatles\u2019 claims with \"The internet is bigger than Jesus or John Lennon\u201d he re-contextualizes Marshall McLuhan's \"the medium is the message\" in the same breath. He urges positivity no matter the obstacles (\u201cGoing Gets Tuff\u201d). Too, he reveals a tattered heart to the world on tracks like \u201cRare Hearts\u201d and \u201cLove Test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my chance to let it all out,\u201d Nielsen says of these songs. \u201cI kind of bottle things up and don\u2019t really get emotional. But I think if I don\u2019t open up, I\u2019d be a really stale person.\u201d\n\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/392"}, {"date": "2015-10-02 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/490221854463722/", "name": "Melissa Ferrick", "description": "A sweeping new Americana sound from a pioneer out songwriter"}, {"date": "2015-10-08 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/357399271115324/", "name": "Veterans for Peace John Lennon's Birthday Concert", "description": "A benefit for the Veterans for Peace Chapter 93 scholarship fund"}, {"date": "2015-10-09 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/828144513907766/", "name": "Alasdair Fraser & Natalie Haas", "description": "New music for fiddle and cello"}, {"date": "2015-10-10 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/555152371292802/", "name": "The Ben Daniels Band", "description": "\"Reminiscent of Adam Duritz in early Counting Crows\"\u2014Wilde Boomerz"}, {"date": "2015-10-16 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/916322731747958/", "name": "That 1 Guy 10/16/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "description": "That 1 Guy live in concert!\n\nWith an extensive and amazing track record of unique and imaginative performances featuring his curious instrument and copious amounts of originality, Mike Silverman, a/k/a That1Guy, has set himself apart as a true one-of-a-kind talent that rivals any other artist currently in the entertainment industry. \n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/403"}, {"date": "2015-10-17 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/729189813857341/", "name": "The Verve Pipe", "description": "New music from one of Michigan's all-time most popular bands"}, {"date": "2015-10-18 19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/572487256187927/", "name": "Loudon Wainwright III", "description": "\"Has actually gotten better as he's gotten older\"\u2014New York Times"}, {"date": "2015-10-22 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1602650766641790/", "name": "Ed Kowalczyk\u2014Throwing Copper Unplugged", "description": "Live's frontman and guitarist in an unplugged show"}, {"date": "2015-10-23 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1449453185349502/", "name": "Carbon Leaf", "description": "A down-home eclectic mix"}, {"date": "2015-10-25 19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1599438703667987/", "name": "Lee Ann Womack", "description": "One of country's most respected songstresses in an intimate show"}, {"date": "2015-10-29 20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1401156626878751/", "name": "The Milk Carton Kids", "description": "New music from this sensational harmony duo"}, {"date": "2015-11-05 20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/393619904163175/", "name": "Adrian Legg", "description": "\"He sounds like an orchestra\"\u2014St. Petersburg Times"}, {"date": "2015-11-19 20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1130930323600503/", "name": "The Sweet Water Warblers\u2014May Erlewine, Rachael Davis, & Lindsay Lou", "description": "A Michigan supergroup!"}, {"date": "2016-01-11 19:30:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/780337908747994/", "name": "Royal Philharmonic Orchestra", "description": "Monday, January 11, 2016, 7:30 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\nFounded by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra made its UMS debut in 1950 and last performed in Hill Auditorium in 1992.
