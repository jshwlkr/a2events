A single on the Pokemon: The First Movie soundtrack, opening gigs for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears, a biography and video collection, and appearances on Nickelodeon set the stage for his third album, 2000's Aaron's Party (Come Get It).

Successful tours with both the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears kept him busy into the next year, but by the spring of 2002 he was back in the studio again.

March 5 | 9pm | $15 Cover | 18+\n\nElectric Six -  Mortality. It\u2019s the primary reason we don\u2019t live forever. If not for our mortality, the number of years each of us would have to roam this earth would be as infinite as the sands of time running through the earth itself. When extraterrestrials eventually make first contact with us within the next twenty years, the first glaringly obvious thing they will notice\u2026is that we die. They will come to our planet with sinister intentions and they will immediately have the upper hand because we die\u2026and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a simple as that. And it\u2019s all because of our mortality.\n\nWhile aliens (and the government!!!!!) will always be there to kill us, we have for generations used our cold dead hands to clutch onto whatever silver lining we could sew into the dark cloud of our everlasting mortality. Specifically, we tell ourselves that we can live forever, not in corporeal form, but through our creations of art\u2026and our expressions of love.\n\nThusly, art and love are more important than ever, because they are now the conduits that preserve our life forces. If you don\u2019t create art and you don\u2019t love nobody\u2026well then, you will be forgotten, rather quickly. No one wants to be forgotten rather quickly. No one more so\u2026than Electric Six.\n\nElectric Six understands all this stuff as it prepares to unveil its eleventh studio album Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, which will be released on October 6 on Metropolis Records. The album is steeped in themes of mortality, death, discorporation and discoloration\u2026all while it tries to convince you it is actually a work of art, a labour of love.\n\nFrom the pounding, driving opener, \u201cDrone Strikes\u201d, through the 1970s guitar anthem \u201cTwo Dollar Two\u201d, Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die! reveals that Electric Six knows that it is going to die, but will not go out quietly. From there, the album moves through the pop goodness of \u201cKids Are Evil\u201d and \u201cA Variation of Elaine\u201d, the prog-rock showmanship of \u201cSlow Motion Man\u201d, and even a tribute to Elvis Presley in his more rotund years with \u201cDime Dime Penny Dime\u201d.\n\n\u201cBig Red Arthur\u201d is the anchor track of the album, as it emits a rock-opera bombast that is reminiscent of Radiohead sodomizing David Bowie in the center of his mind. It, like most of the songs on this record, is about death\u2026but it\u2019s kind of funny because it\u2019s only about the death of a fake, out-of-shape drunk Santa Claus who is too fucking stupid to make it down the chimney correctly. In this case, we just end up laughing at death. And that\u2019s uplifting.\n\nTo summarize, mortality is everywhere, and this fall, thanks to their new record Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, Electric Six will be everywhere too. Everybody gonna die someday, but with Electric Six\u2019s new album, you no longer have to worry about any of it. Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die is Electric Six\u2019s brand new record for 2015 and it is available on Metropolis Records on Oct. 2. You can come see Electric Six play in your town on the I Wanna Lick The Screen tour, starting in their home state of Michigan on Sept. 25.\n\nWSG: Parlour Tricks", "name": "Electric Six w/ Parlour Tricks 3/5/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-03-06T15:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1520482404946720/", "description": "One day at a time, discover colorful Motor City moments in history spanning more than three centuries.

He has returned home to the Bay Area after living in Los Angeles these past three years, and is self-producing his new album with help from friends in Berkeley and San Francisco. The Zombie Dinosaur LP revisits the satirical, funny, uptempo style of Lars\u2019 2004 debut album, the Laptop EP. It features guest appearances by Watsky, Kool Keith, and Less than Jake\u2019s Roger Lima. Zombie Dinosaur tackles such topics as postfeminism, in a nod to Game of Thrones (\u201cDragon Blood\u201d); disappointing reunion bands with very few of their original members (\u201cSublime with Rome is Not the Same thing as Sublime\u201d); hipster parenting (\u201cHipster Mom\u201d); and the current state of EDM (\u201cSigning Dubstep\u201d). The project was funded entirely by Lars\u2019s third highly successful Kickstarter campaign, through which he raised over $42k to create and release Zombie Dinosaur under his own label, Horris Records. In the ten years that have followed his debut release, the Laptop EP, Lars has independently produced and released three other solo full-length albums, four EPs, and a number of mixtapes. He has collaborated with KRS-One, mentored and helped develop the career of fellow Stanford alum K.Flay (with whom he collaborated on the 2009 Single and Famous EP), opened for Nas and Snoop Dogg, and played multiple summers on the Vans Warped Tour. He has also headlined club shows across the US and in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Lars has spoken and presented at two different TEDx conferences, performed at Carnegie Hall with a live string section (at Scholastic\u2019s 2012 Art and Writing Awards \u2013 where he debuted the video for his song, \u201cFlow Like Poe,\u201d which is the lead single on his 2012 Edgar Allan Poe EP). Lars has developed and grown Horris Records in this past decade, signing the label\u2019s first artist, Weerd Science (the solo hip-hop project of Cohered & Cambria\u2019s drummer, Josh Eppard). Lars has continued to produce music videos for himself and his friends, including a cameo credit on past musical collaborator \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic\u2019s 2014 \u201cLame Claim to Fame\u201d (for which Lars was given a special shout out in the liner notes to Al\u2019s Grammy Award winning album, Mandatory Fun). Having been labeled as one of the pioneers of the underground \u201cnerdcore hip-hop\u201d subgenre, Lars has recently expanded from the studio to the classroom. With visiting scholar/teacher residencies at USC, and in the UK, and across the US in Nantucket, Florida, California, Alaska, and Kansas, Lars has found joy in educating young people about \u201clit-hop,\u201d a subject term he coined to highlight the connections between literature, classical poetry, and the cultural history of rap. Lars has continued to work closely with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, teaching workshops on preventing self-harm, and positive ways to use music as creative therapy for depression. He has also worked with the American Heart Association, promoting youth heart health. It\u2019s been quite a decade.

Instead of addressing the sweep of the nation, American authors, artists, geographers, and politicians shifted from the larger reach of the globe to the more manageable scope of the local and sectional.\n\nParadoxically, that local representation became the primary mode through which early Americans construed their emerging national identity.

The loss of a life, a love, a job, a home, will shake our foundation and we will inevitably crumble.  We then consider ourselves defeated; disheartened and utterly broken. But there is power in the acknowledgment of brokenness.\n\nNever Not Broken is taken from the Hindu Goddess Akhilanda or the 'Always Broken Goddess'. \"Akhilanda derives her power from being broke: in flux, pulling herself apart, living in different selves [and states of being] at the same time, from never becoming a whole that has limitations.\" (*1)\n\n\"Fluid connections, the celebration of ambiguity and a sense of ritual in chaos... deeply invested in the notion of complexity, this work will explore the arena of [brokenness] as an entree to rapture.  Artists working in this mode push the deconstruction and dissolution of centre, definitions and boundaries to reach the sublime terror [and beauty] of placelessness [and brokenness]\" *(2)\n\nBrokenness is not indicative of weakness or inability, but rather can be a strong driving force towards creative output as a means of analysis, internalizing, and coping for many artists.  This show seeks work that was created from a state of, and acknowledges our, Never Not Brokenness.\n\n(*1) Excerpt from the online article Why Lying Broken in a Pile on Your Bedroom Floor is a Good Idea by Julie Peters, Elephant Journal\n\n(*2) Excerpt from the Essay Beneath the Remains by Shamin M.

Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind. The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, \u201cLove don\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas. Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced  into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America\u2019s vast inequality\u2014and to people\u2019s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship. Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary and crucial piece of work. Read it.

The family-owned and operated Pio Tosini company has become one of the most credible and sought-after producers of Prosciutto di Parma and has been in operation for over 80 years. There are only four ingredients that go into this ham and they are Italian pigs, salt, air and time. At Pio Tosini, a curing time of over 500 days (more than 100 days longer than typical prosciutto production) allows for slow and even salt penetration, assuring the sweetness of the hams. Each ham is trimmed, deboned by hand and personally selected.\n\nThe roots of the Pio Tosini company run deep and date back to the beginning of the last century (1905) in the heart of northern Italy, where Ferrante Tosini (Pio Tosini\u2019s father) started his business slaughtering pigs and curing his own cuts of pork meat in the back room of the family\u2019s grocery store. After World War I he was assisted by his young son Pio and together they gradually improved the business, experimenting with new processing techniques and curing methods. Today Pio Tosini is still a family company, with Ferrante\u2019s great-grandson and Pio\u2019s grandson Giovanni Bianchi carrying out the traditions of the 111 year old company.\n\nChef Alex and Giovanni have collaborated on a menu that highlights the complex flavors of the ham throughout the meal, each course celebrating the sweetness of the hams.

It\u2019s a powerful introduction, enormous and overwhelming, as Zach Williams, Brian Elmquist, and Kanene Pipkin testify mightily to life\u2019s great struggles and joys, heralding the morning that dispels the dark night: \u201cThen came the morning! It was bright, like the light that you kept from your smile!\u201d Working with producer Aaron Dessner of the National, the Lone Bellow has created a sound that mixes folk sincerity, gospel fervor, even heavy metal thunder, but the heart of the band is harmony: three voices united in a lone bellow.\n\n\"The feeling I get singing with Zach and Brian is completely natural and wholly electrifying,\u201d says Kanene. \u201cOur voices feel like they were made to sing together.\"\n\nLong before they combined their voices, the three members of the Lone Bellow were singing on their own. Brian had been writing and recording as a solo artist for more than a decade, with three albums under his own name. Kanene and her husband Jason were living in Beijing, China, hosting open mic nights, playing at local clubs and teaching music lessons. Zach began writing songs in the wake of a family tragedy: After his wife was thrown from a horse, he spent days in the hospital at her bedside, bracing for the worst news. The journal he kept during this period would eventually become his first batch of songs as a solo artist. Happily, his wife made a full recovery.\n\nWhen Kanene\u2019s brother asked her and Zach to sing \u201cO Happy Day\u201d together at his wedding, they discovered their voices fit together beautifully, but starting a band together seemed impossible when they lived on opposite sides of the world. Brian soon relocated to New York and Kanene moved there to attend culinary school a couple years later. The three got together in their new hometown to work on a few songs of Zach\u2019s, he\u2019d been chipping away at the scene as a solo artist for awhile by then. After hitting those first harmonies did they decide to abandon all other pursuits. Soon the trio was playing all over the city, although they considered Rockwood Music Hall on the Lower East Side to be their home. They opened for the Civil Wars, Dwight Yokam, Brandi Carlile and the Avett Brothers, and their self-titled debut, produced by Nashville\u2019s Charlie Peacock (the Civil Wars, Holly Williams) and released in January 2013, established them as one of the boldest new acts in the Americana movement.\n\nAfter two hard years of constant touring, the band was exhausted but excited. By 2014, they had written nearly 40 songs on the road and were eager to get them down on tape. After putting together a list of dream producers, they reached out to their first choice, the National guitarist Aaron Dessner, who has helmed albums by the L.A. indie-rock group Local Natives and New York singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten.\n\n\u201cIt occurred to me that it would be fun to get together and make music with them,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cMy main interest in producing records is community and friendship more than making money. I already do a lot of traveling and working with the National, so when I have to time to work with other artists, it should be fun and meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAaron is just so kind,\u201d Zach says. \u201cAnd he has surrounded himself with all these incredibly talented people, like Jonathan Low, the engineer. His brother Bryce [Dessner, also a guitarist for the National] wrote these amazing brass and string arrangements, and he got some of his friends to play with us.\u201d\n\nDessner and the Lone Bellow spent two weeks recording at Dreamland in upstate New York, a nineteenth-century church that had been converted into a homey studio. The singers found the space to inspire the emotional gravity necessary for the material and the acoustics they were looking for. (For Kanene, Dreamland had one other bonus: \u201cI\u2019m a big Muppets fan, and it looks exactly like the church where Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem lived.\u201d)\n\nAaron set them up in a circle in what had once been the sanctuary, with microphones hanging in the rafters to capture the sound of their voices bleeding together. Most of the vocals were recorded in single takes, a tactic that adds urgency to songs like \u201cHeaven Don\u2019t Call Me Home\u201d and \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Love Me.\u201d \u201cThere were a couple of times when somebody sang the wrong word or hit a bad note, and we just had to keep going,\u201d says Zach, who says that recording \u201cMarietta\u201d in particular was daunting\u2014especially the moment near the end when he hits an anguished high note, bends it even higher, and holds it for an impossibly long time. It\u2019s a startling display of vocal range, but it\u2019s also almost unbearably raw in its emotional honesty.\n\n\u201c\u2018Marietta\u2019 is probably the darkest song on the whole record,\u201d Zach explains, \u201cand it\u2019s based on something that happened between my wife and me. The band was getting ready to record that song when all of a sudden my wife showed up with our youngest baby. It was a great surprise, a beautiful moment. So I was able to go out and sing that song, knowing she was there to help me carry the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are true stories,\u201d says Brian. \u201cThese aren\u2019t things we made up. We tried to write some songs that had nothing to do with our personal stories, but we just didn\u2019t respond to them. But we\u2019re best buds, so we know each others\u2019 personal stuff and trust each other to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it.\u201d Case in point: Brian wrote \u201cCall to War\u201d about his own struggles during his twenties, but gave the song to Kanene to sing. \u201cThe content is painful and brutal,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the imagery, the vocals, they build something delicate and ethereal. That kind of contrast illuminates the true beauty and power of a song.\u201d\n\nSays Brian, \u201cWe do this one thing together, and we carry each other. Hopefully that makes the listener want to be a part of it. It becomes a communal thing, which means that there\u2019s never a sad song to sing. It\u2019s more a celebration of the light and the dark.\u201d", "name": "The Lone Bellow 3/25/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-03-26T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1663165150570187/", "description": "Saturday, March 26, 2016, 8:00 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\nBach\u2019s complete Sonatas and Partitas have long been a \u201cMount Everest\u201d of the violin repertoire \u2014 music that performers return to throughout their lives.

Their first full-length album, released in February, 2014, on Anticon and Big Dada has been given the kind of critical appraisal normally held hidden in the filing cabinets of dusty music journos and only brought out, along with the bottle of fine blended whisky for those special occasions, those special rock occasions. You know the kind, when a credible bunch of guitar, bass and drum twenty-somethings from some northern town in the UK or from Indianapolis USA put something together in the studio that reaches out and reminds everyone that modern life isn\u2019t rubbish. Which is a weird reaction for a group who sit in some non-categorisable space between genres ancient and modern, who take hiphop and pop and dip it in a tie-dye mix of Ronnettes and krautrock and ragga and dub and post-punk and afropsych\u2026 and make something, something, something.\n\nMany years before dropping DEAD the three individuals who became Young Fathers were apprentice young men. 14 years old, meeting in a sweaty dancing circle in the infamous original Bongo Club in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. Moving to the in-your-face beats of early noughties hiphop, R&B and Dancehall and then at the end of the night, agreeing to meet at solemn faced would-be producer G\u2019s house, to \u2018make records\u2019 on an ancient karaoke machine. The three of them, already looking like their future selves: Alloysious, city street holy man, sad eyes to the stars, past of the Liberian war atrocities buried in childhood scar tissue; Kayus, face exploding from frowns to huge laughter, pure naija boy on the outside but reflective and always feeling far away from his Nigerian home on the inside; and G, quietly watching and waiting for good things to come, practising the serious don\u2019t fuck street face for the neds where he grew up, but nurturing a heart of soul.\n\nFrom the bedroom to the basement. It took them a few years before they found the small underground studio in Leith where they could perfect the uniqueness already nascent in the early days. Here they developed what they call, like the Sicilian mafia, \u2018our thing\u2019. Recording processes that involve ritual, musical techniques more usually found in bebop jazz, playing with ways to write lyrics and tunes, scouring the further reaches and always recoiling from clich\u00e9. But always, always staying true to the Rules of Pop which demand hooks, energy, sparkle, accessibility, passion and beats that vibrate below the waist. From this point came their first release, what was originally conceived as a mixtape, literally only available on individually recorded cassettes with hand printed sleeves: TAPE ONE was the moment, recorded in a week, ready to release in two.\n\nShortly thereafter, TAPE TWO was recorded and a deal with far-out Los Angeles hiphopping label, Anticon inked. TAPE TWO took the dirty mounds of its predecessor and moulded beautiful sand sculptures, sealed by the sea, with the same processes, the same inspiration, gone deeper, gone darker. A year after its release TAPE TWO wins the Scottish Album Of The Year Award (2014), an indication, perhaps, that people are really starting to get it. YFs are just happy more people are listening, even if that 20 grand prize money does come in handy for debts and mashed up gear. And a final, critical tick from the music business comes at the end of summer when the album is nominated for a Mercury award.\n\nDid I mention the live show? I don\u2019t believe so\u2026 on an insane tour of the USA, UK and Europe, heading over to Australia, Japan, Russia and then back to Europe. A huge 27-date UK & European tour preceded standout performances at SXSW, with a 33-date US tour supporting Anticon\u2019s Baths before playing a homecoming show at the Park Stage at Glastonbury. By the end of this year, YFs will have driven around the world one and a half times and flown it several times more. What happens? Each time they appear as a support, the headliner regrets and celebrates, because, if the headliner can\u2019t hope to make the desired impact after the explosion of uber-watt energy that is a Young Fathers show, they can at least reflect and bask in the knowledge that they were partly responsible for something special happening.\n\nWhen they headline, they squeeze hours into 45 minutes and leave the audience exhausted from spectacle and bass, necks aching from craning, ears ringing and a delayed smile forming as they leave after pointless demands for more. (Of course, YFs never give more, because they have given all they have).\n\nSounds like hyperbole? Read the reviews\u2026 The Guardian were particularly kind about DEAD, Alexis Petridis wrote: \u201cYoung Fathers have quietly constructed a strange and intoxicating musical universe that feels entirely their own\u201d \u2013 Guardian 4/5 (Lead Review). I know the group intimately and yet they still shock me on a regular basis. Not with anything as base as the kind of look-at-me desperation of a shocking rocking Rocky Horror spit show, nor with pyro and cannons and strippers or any of the other circus tricks. Just with presence and passion and looking like that beamed in from another world lost aliens with a message of love type of group. With intense engagement\u2026 intense\u2026 the Johnny Rotten, Ian Curtis, James Brown kind. Taking that brief blast of special that is normally only allowed to boys from terraced houses for a couple of years before imp or exp-losion but YFs just, keep it going, impossibly, like an Ethiopian marathon racer. Which should be an indication, dear star watchers, that something special is happening.\n\nOK, 850 odd words and still so much info to impart. How about\u2026 America, it\u2019s like jumping into a deep fat fryer, so many delicious possibilities, like: Jimmy Kimmel, set to take the crown of late night TV chat show hosts, who hosted Young Fathers in June, watched by the entire Anticon roster, performing with blood shot intensity after 24 hours of partying (yes, they party, seriously of course, as you ask) in Los Angeles. More America: the entire staff of KEXP in Seattle, cramming into the control booth and watching in awe during YFs\u2019 radio session there. If you know how many artists go through those doors you\u2019ll know what an accolade that is.\n\nWhat about the BBC? How about all the love from Zane Lowe for the singles, not to mention the weekly shows they made for 1Xtra through October last year (2013) ? Episodes of some outer space Dada drama slotted in amongst all the herbal urban clich\u00e9s. How about being banned by the beeb? Queen Is Dead, from TAPE TWO, officially banned just in case the Queen of Britain pops her clogs at the moment of spinning.\n\nTime to round it up and leave all the untold good stuff for another time. Now signed with Big Dada, Young Fathers are already recording the next album, printing more of their iconic T-shirts (have you got one yet? You\u2019ll probably have to wait), making more videos, sweating their way through the summer festivals, ignoring stupid borders and other constraints in order to bring it, whatever it is, to you.

And now, with their second full-length album Drinking From A Salt Pond, Run River North are poised to push forward and create their own wake as a major voice in today\u2019s music landscape.\n\nSince the band\u2019s beginnings just over four years ago, their rise has been steadily spectacular, marked by appearances on national television, sold-out shows at historic venues, tours with rock and roll royalty and heaps of praise from fans and critics alike. As they blossomed, they embraced their initially folk-driven sound, which found its harmonic home alongside rootsy, foot stomping, sing-along-leading peers like Mumford & Sons, The Head and the Heart, and Of Monsters and Men. Powered by the acoustic-guitar-and-vocals songwriting of frontman Alex Hwang, their 2014 self-titled debut record, produced by Phil Ek (Fleet Foxes, Modest Mouse, Band of Horses), was released with their lineup rounded out by the strings duo of Daniel Chae and Jennifer Rim, Joe Chun on bass, Sally Kang on keys, and John Chong on drums.\n\nAs time and tours passed, the six lives spent in close-quarters began to grind the gears a little differently; their whole dynamic began to change. \u201cWhen we became a band, we mostly played Alex\u2019s songs in band form,\u201d says Chae. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve all put our musical input into it, so the music has changed a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were tired of me on acoustic guitar and everybody singing harmonies,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe were hitting a ceiling, and it wasn\u2019t fun. We had always agreed this band was six-ways, for better or worse. So at the end of last year, after being in the van constantly, we said, \u2018no more touring, let\u2019s write new songs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to grow up pretty fast as a band,\u201d says Chong. \u201cSo this past year, there were times when different perspectives and priorities have butted heads.\u201d\n\nDuring the writing of Drinking From A Salt Pond, the band admits to flaring tempers and tense operations as they worked to redefine their sound, goals and relationships. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of hating each other, almost kicking people out of the band,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe\u2019re being honest and that openness is one of the main thrusts for the album. Embracing the bitter with the sweet, not trying to hide the crappy parts\u2026the crappy parts helped make the good.\u201d Being open about its faults, the band recognizes how the turmoil has helped Run River North create something beautiful.\n\n\u201cThe record we just made, it\u2019s all the difficult stuff we went through so there\u2019s a darker tone to the music. It works,\u201d says Chae.\n\nOne of the first steps in leaving behind their folk roots was to work with new collaborators. Instead of the reverb-heavy, northwest sound of Ek, they recorded in Los Angeles with Lars Stalfors (Cold War Kids, HEALTH, Deap Vally, Matt and Kim) at the production helm. Stalfors opened their eyes to the upbeat energy and electric tone of indie bands like The Walkmen. Throughout Salt Pond the indie rock influence can be heard, with the band nodding inspiration to everyone from Cage the Elephant and Kings of Leon to The National, Death Cab for Cutie, and Cold War Kids, whose studio in San Pedro, CA the band borrowed to make the album. Also, in a move encouraged by their record label, Nettwerk, Hwang and Chae were sent to Nashville for a week in April 2015 to work on a few new tracks with two different co-writers, Lincoln Parish (formerly of Cage the Elephant) and the Kings of Leon collaborator Nick Brown.\n\n\u201cIt was weird but at the same time it was really encouraging,\u201d says Hwang of the co-writing. \u201cIt was like bringing our demos to a blind date.\u201d\n\nThe first song from the Nashville sessions was \u201cRun Or Hide,\u201d co-written with Parish, and from first listen it\u2019s clear that Run River North are exploring bombastic new territory. Hwang, Chae, and Parish came up with an organic way of working that was based on jamming and vibing together, and once the song\u2019s melody was nailed down, the rest came easily. It was immediately hard-hitting than any previous song from the band, with a discernible strut serving as a sonic contrast. When the demo was sent home to LA, the rest of the band was shocked.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone else was really scared,\u201d says Hwang, \u201c\u2018this is not your voice, this is not who we are.\u2019 I was confident it was a really good song and that we were gonna keep it. There\u2019s nothing more aggressive on the record, and that groove on the verses is bigger than the band. The band can\u2019t contain the song.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved it!\u201d says Chong emphatically. \u201cAlex has a very wide range of emotion when he sings\u2014soft, whispery things; really bombastic; rough\u2014this song showcases all of that. I got really excited. When we recorded it, it really showcases more groove. Joe, our bass player, is solid, and the way the melody is created in the verses really adds to that. There\u2019s a really cool contrast happening, but the choruses hit hard.\u201d\n\nThe other song written in Tennessee was the Nick Brown co-penned \u201cCan\u2019t Come Down,\u201d a track with pop qualities that the band does not shy away from recognizing. For that they leaned on Brown heavily, who served almost as a mentor to Hwang and Chae during the sessions, teaching them about pop hooks, authenticity, and Southern tradition. Deciding to go all in on a pop song, the trio rallied behind Brown\u2019s catchy melodies and licks, and what they ended up with is a happy medium that \u201cstill sounds as Run River North as possible,\u201d according to Chong, while simultaneously reaching for the rafters.\n\n\u201cWe really gelled with Nick Brown,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWe had the same idea: \u2018We have enough songs that exemplify us, so let\u2019s try our hand at writing a pop hook.\u2019 With that mentality we came up with \u2018Can\u2019t Come Down.\u2019 Nick wrote the hook, Daniel and Nick wrote the music, and a heavy collaboration on lyrics from everyone. It\u2019s the first song I ever sang the word \u2018baby\u2019 in.\u201d\n\nWith those songs firmly planting the band\u2019s flag in new ground, it is Hwang\u2019s \u201c29\u201d that may be the best indicator of the band Run River North are becoming. A piano and drum fueled anthem examining the ups and downs of transition, it finds the singer posing multiple existential questions at once. \u201cEveryone\u2019s always talking about how if you will something, it\u2019s gonna happen. But, sometimes it doesn\u2019t!\u201d says Hwang. \u201cThat was a realization I wanted to play with: \u2018Your words are cold like the wind\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s kind of like saying, \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think,\u2019 but it\u2019s also a reflection about my words. What I do can be just as insignificant as anyone else. So what are you gonna do about it? You\u2019re 29. \u2018I know it\u2019s home, I know it hurts/I know I\u2019ll end up at the bottom/What if I leave?\u2019 What if we go on this tour and we don\u2019t end up anywhere? The brutal question is, who cares, and why does it matter? Not answering that in the song really helps. The music is still upbeat, it still has the \u2018oh\u2019s\u2019 going on, it\u2019s an anthemic thing. I\u2019m still energetic, I\u2019m not some old dude at 29.\u201d\n\n\u201c29\u201d was written on electric guitar, a tool Hwang has been using more frequently since the end of the debut album\u2019s touring cycle. Originally intended for a more somber feel, at the suggestion of their producer Stalfors, the tempo rose to meet Hwang\u2019s intonations. \u201cIt became this song with so much energy,\u201d says Chong, \u201cit\u2019s probably the fastest song we\u2019ve ever done as a band. It\u2019s new territory for us; it\u2019s very fun. It\u2019s a good transition, with lulled verses and really upbeat instrumentals and choruses. This is a good appetizer for our old fans, as this is who we\u2019ve become.\u201d\n\nEmbracing their natural growth and learning to ride the waves of their personal and musical evolutions with open hearts and nimble hands, Run River North have created a sophomore album that will propel them to the forefront of today\u2019s landscape. Although at times the rushing water of their rise will pool into depths tough to swallow, they have learned to lean on each other and to trust themselves along the way in order to make something lasting and truly beautiful.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, we always said we wanted to play on the biggest stages possible,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cThat\u2019s still the same. But it isn\u2019t some self-indulgent dream of becoming rock stars; we still want to support our families with this, we still have the parents that sacrificed for us and we want to honor them. For us as a band, at times it\u2019s felt like we\u2019ve been drinking from a salt pond\u2014and yet, we still created something pretty fresh that we like and are proud of.\u201d\n\nWSG: The Lighthouse and the Whaler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/634", "name": "Run River North w/ The Lighthouse & The Whaler 4/5/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-06T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1390173447979498/", "description": "March 31 - April 3\nDetroit Opera House\n\nUMS and Michigan Opera Theatre join forces to bring American Ballet Theatre\u2019s new production of The Sleeping Beauty to the Detroit Opera House.

So we decided to just do it quick and dirty, old-school style. Like the open mic nights I used to play: unamplified guitar and vocals, friends with their axes playing along, arrangements arrived at on the fly and infinitely flexible. Four songs later we felt really inspired\u2014me and Matt played a song or two without anybody else around because we\u2019d gotten down to the basement before the others, the total song choice was strictly \u201cwhat do you figure we should play now?\u201d, the mood was relaxed and free\u2026we loved it. Later that night, we decided to strip down the drum kit to essentials and play a choke-the-motor set echoing and elaborating on what we\u2019d done downstairs: a sort of small-ensemble feel, lower in volume but actually higher in intensity. Like what we do in concentrate. It was one of our two favorite performances of the year, the other being the second night at the Fillmore. It felt like acres of new terrain opening up atop an ancient foundation. As soon as it was over, we all wanted to do it again. So in 2016 we\u2019re taking that set on the road. Not that exact set, obviously; the particulars will vary from night to night. But smaller rooms, audible frequencies, up close and personal: this is the general plan. Making eye contact with people in the back row, being able to go off-mic when I want to and still be heard. Total visibility. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this tour. I love the big album release shows as much as anybody, but that City Winery feel of just playing together with bare essentials in close quarters\u2026there\u2019s nothing like it, and when the whole room locks onto the signal, it\u2019s really special.\nWith: William Tyler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/581", "name": "The Mountain Goats w/ William Tyler 4/8/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-09T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1217913291571431/", "description": "Sat. April 9 | 8pm | 18+ | $10 adv./ $12 day of\n\nFlint Eastwood is the evolution of the creative side of Detroit-based multi-talented artist Jax Anderson. Flint Eastwood is what happens when friends and family gather in the forgotten spaces of an embattled city and are left to create with no rules, no boundaries, and nothing holding them back. Jax's endless creativity is a byproduct of growing up in a talented family.\n\nHer father was one of ten kids, each of whom played guitar and sang. Her oldest brother, Sam, played in punk bands, and Jax spent her teenage years learning the value of passion and acceptance at DIY shows. As she got older, her other brother (and Flint Eastwood collaborator and producer) Seth started playing in bands throughout the Detroit garage rock scene. Their dad worked as a curb address painter to pay the bills once the housing crash made his job as a mortgage broker invalid. During this time, Jax and her brothers went door to door, passing out flyers advertising her father's services, through some of the toughest residential neighborhoods in Detroit. These struggles helped form the vision that drives Flint Eastwood: to give everyone listening (whether live or on record) a momentary escape from the problems we all have.\n\nBetween helping around the house, Jax spent her days in her family's Detroit-area home, without cable and internet, teaching herself to play her father's 12-string Taylor guitar that he left for them in the living room. It was also during this time that her mother's love for Motown music began to influence Jax's knack for the theatrics and power of the Detroit sound, as Mom played records from The Temptations, the Jackson Five, and Earth Wind & Fire.\n\nOnce old enough to break out on her own, Jax briefly moved to a small German tourist town in rural Georgia, where the only station in town played solely pop and country. There, she fell in love with the hooks and harmonies that define American pop music. Later, she moved with Seth to Los Angeles, to mainly focus on writing for licensing opportunities and playing small clubs and house parties around town. While in LA, Jax developed a love for film, hopping on tour with bands every chance she could get as a self-taught videographer. Her experiences on the West Coast still influence Jax's push to make her musical endeavors into well-rounded multimedia presentations (mixing music with theatrical lighting, video projection, and costumes).\n\nUpon returning home to Detroit at the very beginning of the much-maligned city's recent resurgence, Jax's explosive and endearing personality on stage became the driving force behind Flint Eastwood. But through it all, it was the songs that were always the focus.\n\nOn their now sold-out debut EP Late Nights In Bolo Ties (2013), Jax and her friends mixed elements of pulsing electronic tracks with blistering bluesy guitar licks, all with a spaghetti-western backdrop, inspired by Sunday night movie sessions with Jax and her father.\n\nOn the forthcoming EP, Small Victories (to be released October 23), Jax has returned to her Detroit roots, mixing a taste of the theatricality of Motown music with her more recently found love for pop music. The result is six songs full of hooks. The type of tracks that you turn up a little too loud, close your eyes, and forget where you are for four minutes. In a live setting, the songs are taken to another level entirely, mixing a CHVRCHES-like depth with a twenty | one | pilots-style flair for the dramatic. This approach has led the band to rapidly gain an ever-growing fanbase. Their last two hometown headline plays have sold out (400+ tickets per show), and the band has toured heavily through the Midwest, mixing festival looks like Electric Forest, MoPop Festival, and Midpoint Music Festival with club appearances alongside acts such as Foxy Shazam, Mayer Hawthorne, Betty Who, X Ambassadors, and Andrew WK.\n\nSmall Victories was crafted and polished in Detroit\u2019s second oldest church, now repurposed as Assemble Sound, a hub of Detroit creativity that fosters artists through collaboration. In this crumbling but inspiring location, the new record was created as a coping mechanism to help Jax deal with the loss of her mother, who was her biggest fan and inspiration. As the listener makes their way through the EP, they experience Jax making her way through her mother's illness and passing, railing against it, dealing with the aftermath associated with such a loss, eventually accepting it, and using it as a driving force to continue to create.\n\nJax broke the EP down in one simple thought:\n\n\"Small Victories comes from the idea that doing anything creative in life takes a lot of persistence, struggle, and hustle. It's easy to expect that the spoils will come easily and be immediately fruitful. But if you focus on the little things, the \"small victories\", you realize that it's those things that are the most rewarding. That's what keeps me going.\"\n\nThe lead single is the EP's first track, \"Find What You're Looking For\", which is Jax's interpretation of her mother's final words to her:\n\n\"Don't let this break you\".", "name": "Flint Eastwood 4/9/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-12T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/523621744459410/", "description": "Tuesday, April. 12 | 9pm | 18+ | $13 Adv./ $15 Day of\n\nDenzel Curry 2055 The Ult Experience\nwsg: Allan Kingdom and Sdotbraddy\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/636", "name": "Denzel Curry - 2055: The Ult Experience 4/12/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-13T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1698946970352936/", "description": "Wed.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-21T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1683772608545604/", "description": "Thu. April 21 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nI don\u2019t know how to write a bio for an album. I\u2019ve never written one. I\u2019m a comedian. My job is to talk onstage for long enough that the trapped, drunken audience has to buy more chicken wings from the club. I am not qualified to write about music. And yet here I am, writing a bio for the new The Thermals record, We Disappear. Thank god it\u2019s a great fucking record.\n\nThe first time I heard The Thermals was on broken headphones while riding the A Train to Rockaway, Brooklyn, flying mere feet over a frozen Jamaica Bay on a too-bright January morning. I had just fallen in love with a wonderful, terrible woman who was thousands of miles away. I was very fragile, I had no boundaries, and I was the strongest I\u2019d ever been. And that\u2019s how this album feels. There\u2019s a new vulnerability here, but The Thermals\u2019 sound is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nThe Thermals are best at making songs you put on mixtapes named \u2018Drunken Sing-alongs When You\u2019re Sad.\u2019 They specialize in late-night, secret conversations about feeling simultaneously romantic and resentful over being raised Catholic. They\u2019re the soundtrack to breaking glass, and an ode to the beauty of brokenness.\n\nThey say that the mark of intelligence is the ability to hold two disparate and conflicting truths in the mind at the same time: I am a good person; I am not a good person. We Disappear lives in this delicate, in-between place: at once hard and noisy, while also soft and personal. And seeming contradictions abound on this album. We Disappear is an all-too-real, dark, and intensely personal album \u2013 in the past most of singer Hutch Harris\u2019 lyrics have been mostly fictitious tales \u2013 about how we try to outrun demise, whether personal or physical. It is an emotional document of how two people can tear each other apart, while simultaneously making you wanna get up and jump around the room.\n\nThe deeply dark, yet oddly catchy \u201cHeart Went Cold\u201d plays on the double metaphor of loss of love/life and features the sad realization \u201cI pushed you away\u201d, but is immediately followed by the super poppy \u201coh-oh oh\u201d. The classic fucking rock anthem \u201cHey You\u201d is a paranoid fantasy about running from the Grim Reaper as he calls after you, about \u201cbeing terrified of death,\u201d says Harris, but \u201ca celebration of that feeling as opposed to feeling sad about it.\u201d A surprisingly uplifting eulogy of the death of a relationship, \u201cThinking Of You\u201d is explained by Harris as \u201cone of the most straight-forward love songs we\u2019ve ever written, a point-blank post-break up song. It\u2019s a song that says exactly what it means. It and a lot of the record are about regret, i.e. still loving someone after a break-up and hanging on to these feelings.\u201d\n\nWe Disappear is also about separation in terms of technology, how it can isolate us and impact our relationships, and how humans have embraced it to the point where we\u2019ve already assimilated into it. \u201cThe Great Dying\u201d and \u201cInto the Code\u201d examine how we\u2019re so afraid we\u2019re going to be forgotten, or overlooked, that we upload everything about our lives onto the Internet.\n\nHarris explains, \u201cTechnology, love and death are the three obsessions of the record. Our privacy used to be so important to us and now everything has changed \u2013 we freely offer once private information about relationships and reveal everything about our day-to-day lives. We\u2019re trying to preserve our life digitally so when we\u2019re gone people won\u2019t forget us. We\u2019re using technology to become immortal. You can even set up Facebook and Twitter accounts to continue updating after you die! We Disappear is about how humans fight the inevitable.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure you want to know that the record will come out March 25th, 2016 on Saddle Creek, that it features the longest running Thermals line-up of Hutch Harris, Kathy Foster, and Westin Glass, and that it was recorded in Portland, OR at Kung Fu Bakery (The Shins, Tegan and Sara) and in Seattle, WA at The Hall of Justice (Nirvana, Mudhoney), and produced by Chris Walla (formerly of Death Cab For Cutie). But what really matters is that this record GETS IT. It walks that fine line between truth and lies, between death and life, between depression and joy \u2013 all the while recognizing that one cannot exist without the other. And it brings us with it. That\u2019s the reason to listen to this record: Because it\u2019s a fucking great album, by an amazing band.

Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Backin the Ring. Chris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet,Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, TheLumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records. Chris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases.In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist. Her latest album, Backin the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimedHow I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons. \u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms.For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards. \n\nWSG: Anna Vogelzang\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/595", "name": "Chris Pureka w/ Anna Vogelzang 4/28/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/480751802102134/", "description": "Michigan's cult hero of comedy", "name": "Heywood Banks"}, {"date": "2016-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/930690620345924/", "description": "Don Campbell is a contemporary/country crossover and folk-rock singer/songwriter whose presentation of music supports the story in the song and welcomes the audience on board for the ride.

The band consists of Jeanne Mackey, Tom Voiles, Linda Teaman, and Laz Slomovits. The name Harmony Bones comes from an acupuncture point that harmonizes imbalances and promotes clear thinking, seeing, and hearing.\nJeanne, Tom, Linda and Laz have joined forces to explore a wide range of traditional, contemporary and original folk songs. Rich vocal harmonies and an array of instruments -- guitar, mandolin, flute, pennywhistle, fiddle, banjo, percussion, sitar -- combine to make Harmony Bones.\nSinger/songwriter Jeanne Mackey offers a blend of emotional intensity, wry humor, and global consciousness. In addition to original tunes, her repertoire ranges from Dar Williams to Patsy Cline, from Pete Seeger to Irving Berlin. A seasoned guitarist, she draws on a variety of styles -- folk, classic swing, funky blues, and more -- with the occasional sprinkle of mandolin, accordion, or banjo. Mackey rocked the 1970s East Coast topical music circuit as a young musician advocating feminist values and social justice.  In 2010, Mackey created \"Drop The Knife: A Memoir-in-Song,\" an evening of original songs and stories exploring the meaning of homeland, curses, death, and magic.\nLinda Teaman and Tom Voiles do much of their singing and playing with Nutshell, an Ann Arbor-based Celtic roots band. Nutshell plays for contra-dances and performs at festivals across North America.\nLinda is a singer who brings depth of understanding, warmth and sensitivity to the music. In 2005, her graduation recital for a degree in k-12 choral music had her singing in five languages, encompassing musical forms such as Irish sean nos singing and Italian and German arias by composers Purcell, Mozart and Brahms. She leads the Rudolf Steiner Community Singers, a small choir that sings uncommon Christmas and seasonal songs of celebration.  She hopes you'll forgive her classical background and that she is redeemed by her love of folk music.  In addition to vocals, she adds light percussion to the mix.\nTom consumes a well-rounded musical diet that ranges from Celtic to Indian to rock and roll. He enjoys mixing different styles while maintaining a respect for the traditions from which they spring. Tom has studied North Indian Classical music, Moroccan folk drumming and western classical flute. He has worked with performance artists, dancers, mimes and poets, including Hosain Mosavat, Gerry the Fool, Matthew Smith, ML Liebler and the Magic Poetry Band.\nLaz Slomovits is one of the twin brothers in Ann Arbor\u2019s nationally-known children\u2019s music duo, Gemini. A fine singer and multi-instrumentalist, Laz is starting his 4nd year playing music. His songs are featured in songbooks used by music teachers throughout the country, and Gemini's recordings have won numerous awards. In addition, Laz has had a notable solo career. In his solo work, Laz is best known for his powerful musical settings of the poetry of ancient Sufi mystics Rumi and Hafiz, as well as that of contemporary American poets.", "name": "Harmony Bones at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-05-15T19:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1080836985282330/", "description": "The ears and eyes of America!", "name": "The Corn Potato String Band"}, {"date": "2016-05-18T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/164009360644535/", "description": "Ty Greenstein (of Girlyman) and Ingrid Elizabeth (of Coyote Grace) in a new roots duo.

These songs and numerous others have made John Ford Coley a singing legend.\nJohn is most revered as half of the duo England Dan and John Ford Coley. The classically-trained pianist and talented guitarist continues performing the gold and platinum record hits for audiences around the world. Some of Coley\u2019s other hits are, \u201cGone Too Far,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again,\u201d and, \u201cSad To Belong.\"\nJohn\u2019s experiences comprise a broad background. Although he performed throughout high school and college as a classical and rock pianist, he chose to major in English Literature in college, and is an avid student of history. In the mid-1980\u2019s, John began acting in television and in feature films. He recently penned a book, \"Backstage Pass,\" about his years in the music industry.\nwww.johnfordcoley.com", "name": "John Ford Coley at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-09-16T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1653085994944878/", "description": "At Woodstock, as a New York kid barely known outside the coffeehouse circuit in Greenwich Village, she sang her song, \"Beautiful People\" and inspired the first panorama of candles and cigarette lighters ever raised at a concert event. That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.

During the following nomadic decade, Lou studied classical voice and music theory in college while Peter continued an unfocused fascination with surrealist art, beatnik poetry, and jug band music. Early influences of American and British musical comedy and folk music fed a growing repertoire of original songs. A brief marriage in the early seventies resolved into a lifelong friendship, and by the late seventies and early eighties the two were honing their skills playing regular weekly concerts in Madison, becoming full-time musicians and songwriters in 1979. During those early years they wrote new songs every week, many about the history, cheese, beer and strange politics of their home state. By the mid '80s they were traveling all across the country, still writing and singing, but now with a broader perspective, finding that the quirks of their home state were not so much Midwestern as human. In twenty-five years of performing together, Lou and Peter have released twenty albums and four songbooks worth of hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound songs, rich with word play and interesting images. Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton and Tom Lehrer count themselves among their fans. Their work has appeared in numerous compilations such as the popular \"Rise Up Singing\" songbook, in periodicals like \"SING OUT! Magazine\", and in many audio compilations. Berryman songs are being sung around the world by a legion of professional musicians including Peter, Paul and Mary, Garrison Keillor and Peggy Seeger. They have appeared numerous times on such national programs as NPR's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Weekend Edition.\"\nwww.louandpeter.com", "name": "Lou and Peter Berryman at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-10-14T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/197527007266742/", "description": "lauriemcclain.com", "name": "Laurie McLain at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-10-28T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/147078752335941/", "description": "There is no better storyteller than Chuck Brodsky.  Ranging from poignant to hilarious, his songs are about the little things in the lives of everyday people.  Chuck's soulful and compassionate voice brings his characters to life, and is the perfect instrument for infusing his lyrics with heartfelt humanity or biting wit. His spoken introductions to his songs can be as spellbinding as his colorful lyrics, which he brings to life with a well-travelled voice and a delivery that's natural and conversational. His groove-oriented strumming and fingerpicking draw on influences from the mountains of western North Carolina where he now lives, and from lots of different good old traditional folk stuff of all kinds. Chuck is widely known for his many wonderful songs about the heroes -- and zeroes -- of baseball. His latest CD is The Baseball Ballads 2.\nwww.chuckbrodsky.com", "name": "Chuck Brodsky at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513216465641630/", "description": "http://www.donhenry.com/", "name": "Don Henry at Green Wood Coffee House"}]
