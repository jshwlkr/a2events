As a young girl growing up in an affluent suburb bordering Detroit, Alice Townley witnesses a tragic accident at her parents\u2019 lavish party. In the years that follow, Alice is left mostly in the care of the household staff, free to forge friendships with other pampered and damaged teens. When she and her friend Mike decide to pin a crime on another student at their exclusive high school, the consequences will reverberate for years to come.\n\nSet between 1974 and 2012, Fordon\u2019s intricately woven stories follow Alice and Mike through high school, college, and into middle age, but also skillfully incorporate stories of their friends, family, acquaintances, and even strangers who are touched by the same themes of privilege, folly, neglect, and resilience. A WWII veteran sleepwalks out of his home at night, led by vivid flashbacks. A Buddhist monk is assaulted by a robber while seated in meditation. A teenaged girl is shot walking home from the corner store with a friend. A lifelong teacher of blind children is targeted by vandals at the school she founded.\n\nGarden for the Blind visits suburban and working-class homes, hidden sanctuaries and dangerous neighborhoods, illustrating the connections between settings and relationships (whether close or distant) and the strange motivations that keep us moving forward. All readers of fiction will enjoy the nimble unfolding of Fordon\u2019s narrative in this collection.\n\nPrior to writing fiction and poetry, Kelly Fordon worked at the NPR member station in Detroit and for National Geographic magazine. Her fiction, poetry, and book reviews have appeared in The Boston Review, The Florida Review, Flashquake, The Kenyon Review, and various other journals. She is the author of two poetry chapbooks, On the Street Where We Live, which won the 2011 Standing Rock Chapbook Contest, and Tell Me When It Starts to Hurt, which was published by Kattywompus Press in 2013. She received her MFA in fiction writing from Queens University of Charlotte and works for InsideOut Literary Arts in Detroit as a writer-in-residence.", "date": "2015-08-26T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/886797341385975/", "name": "Kelly Fordon"}, {"description": "Join us for our next Community Impact Day!

Martha Reeves and the Vandellas recorded throughout the 60\u2019s for Motown\u2019s Gordy label, charting 24 R&B hits including, \u201cNowhere to Run\u201d, \u201cJimmy Mack\u201d, \u201cHeat Wave\u201d, and their signature \u201cDancing in The Street\u201d. \n\nJune 11th - Joshua Davis\nJoshua\u2019s amazing talent led him on a journey that has landed him as a finalist on the most recent series of NBC\u2019s The Voice. Michigan\u2019s Joshua Davis was raised in the folk tradition: the music, the social movements, the land. He writes songs that blend the roots of American music with gritty rock n' roll and vintage soul. For over 15 years, Joshua has made a living sharing his songs, stories and knowledge across the US and Canada.  Joshua has an extensive performing background, having appeared at festivals, concert halls, coffeehouses and dives as both a solo act and a member of a group. In addition to his solo act, Joshua has also been the front man for roots ensemble Steppin' In It, been a member of the classic swing band Shout Sister Shout, been in the songwriter showcase band The Starlight Six and much more.\nhttp://www.joshuadavismusic.com \n\nJune 18th - Jessica Hernandez\nJessica Hernandez & The Deltas have had an incredible year including a performance on The Late Show with David Letterman and festival appearances at major shows including Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza.   \nJessica Hernandez & The Deltas are a wide-ranging, high-energy rock n\u2019 roll band from Detroit. Their mercurial, often gritty sound reflects all of the Motor City's musical traditions, as well as some outside its geographical and multicultural boundaries. In their thoroughly modern, driving sound are traces of Motown, tough vintage R&B, Latin grooves, raucous surf, neo-psych, roots rock, cinema jazz, and retro '60s girl group pop. \nhttp://www.jessicahernandezandthedeltas.com \n\n\n6/25 - Michelle Chamuel w/s/g Absofacto\nMichelle Chamuel \nFrom the moment Michelle made her television debut on season 4 of NBC\u2019s The Voice, the bespectacled Massachusetts native and University of Michigan Alumni singer charmed audiences and pop stars alike with her soulful covers. While some may have leapt at the chance to be on The Voice, Chamuel was initially wary of the realities (no pun intended) of submitting to a reality television show \u2013 though she soon found herself happily on team Usher and taking home 2nd place. \n\u201cI went to the show looking for a teacher and it turned out Usher was looking for a student\u201d, says 28-year-old Chamuel. \u201cI was craving the challenges and rewards of being part of a top musical community, and I found that on The Voice.\u201d\nBy the time she took The Voice stage in 2013, Chamuel had spent the better part of a decade fronting the seven-piece Michigan rock band, Ella Riot (formerly My Dear Disco). In the band, Chamuel learned the artistry of performing by touring around the country 200 days a year, releasing several albums, and learning to drive a tour bus that ran on waste vegetable oil. Eventually the fuel ran out; Ella Riot parted ways in 2012 and Chamuel returned to Massachusetts in search of home and solitude.  \nConsidering all the emotion contained within it, \u201cFace the Fire\u201d came together at a breakneck pace. For three weeks, Chamuel and her collaborators, Tyler Duncan and Theo Katzman \u2013 college pals and My Dear Disco band members \u2013 holed up in Chamuel\u2019s home, building the album from musical nuggets each had brought to the sessions. The trio takes influence from several genres across the history of music \u2013 spanning from 80\u2019s pop (\u201cRock It\u201d) and melodic house (\u201cWeight of the World\u201d) to VHS-infused reggae (\u201cMoney\u201d).  The title track on the album is no exception \u2013 showcasing the convergence of Chamuel\u2019s vision and her collaborators ingenuity.  \u201cFace the Fire\u201d serves as a sort of pulsing mission statement, a vamping call to action that Chamuel relates to her own experience in harnessing musical passion. This track, which like the rest of the album, was recorded and produced in Chamuel and Duncan\u2019s home studios, features a tapestry of interlocking percussion, surf-punk bass tones, and a rousing call and answer between Chamuel and her choir.  \n\u201cThe imagery I get when singing the song is that I\u2019m in front of a big, camp-like fire. There are people all around, and I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re ghosts or strangers, but they chime in while I sing. It\u2019s almost a trance-like state \u2013 being pulled towards this fire. Everyone is being pulled towards it.\u201d\nhttp://www.michellechamuel.com \n\nAbsofacto\nAbsofacto is the solo moniker of Jonathan Visger, who is also the lead vocalist and songwriter for Hollow & Akimbo and Mason Proper, in addition to being the former bass player of Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.   \nAbsofacto\u2019s latest single \u201cDissolve\u201d was #1 on Hype Machine\u2019s non-remix charts immediately upon release. \u201cDissolve\u201d can be described as a well-executed burst of eclectic stylistic flair, enjoyably difficult to classify in its welcome mixture of nostalgic pop, electronica and hints of R&B. The impressive stylistic balance is reminiscent of artists like Gorillaz and Beck at their best and most stylistically intuitive \u2014 lofty comparisons but well-deserved comparisons in this case. \nhttp://www.absofacto.com \n\nJuly 9th - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\nJoe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers will make a sprightly young groove doctor out of anyone. With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, it\u2019s no wonder why they are headlining festivals as one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album, Terra Incognita, goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking, Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n\nJuly 23rd - Laith Al-Saadi \nLaith Al-Saadi was crowned \u201cKing of the Blues\u201d by Guitar Center making him one of the top 4 Blues guitarists in the Country.  Laith has been a staple to the Michigan music scene for most of his adult life.  He has shared the stage with greats like Buddy Guy, BB King, Taj Mahal, Kenny Wayne Shepard, Luther Allison, Son Seals and Johnny Winter. Laith is one of the best and most polished guitar-driven acts you are likely to find on earth.  \nIn 2013, Al-Saadi teamed up with producer Jeffrey Weber and an all-star cast of L.A. session legends to make his third release REAL. The album was recorded live to 2-track with no edits, overdubs, auto tune or compression at the world famous Ocean Way Recording Studios in Hollywood. The album features a dream-band of musicians such as Jim Keltner (Drums), Leland Sklar (Bass), Larry Goldings (Hammond B-3), Jimmy Vivino (Rhythm Guitar/ Backing Vox), Tom Scott (Sax), Lee Thornburg (Trumpet), Brandon Fields (Bari Sax), Nick Lane (Trombone / Horn Arranger) and more... \nThe soulful new album is reminiscent of the great musical traditions of New Orleans and Chicago with a splash of Blues, Country, Gospel and Roots Rock, and is arguably Al-Saadi's best work to date.\nhttp://www.laithmusic.com \n\nJuly 30th - Bennett \nBennett is a 3-piece folk-rock group from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Described as \u201cpowerfully original\u201d and \u201chauntingly beautiful\u201d, their music is as unique as it is authentic and matured well beyond its age, garnering praise from both local and national media outlets. Boasting first place in regional competitions, climbing local music charts and playing alongside acts such as The Avett Brothers, OAR, Easton Corbin and Bela Fleck, these boys have quickly established themselves as a force to be reckoned with on the American music scene. Their lush, string driven sound, seemingly effortless harmonies, and willingness to evolve their style set them apart as somewhere between up-and-coming and (somehow) already there. \nhttp://www.bennettband.com \n\n\nAugust 6th - Luke Winslow-King \nCadillac, Michigan native Luke Winslow-King made New Orleans his home about a dozen years ago, and the Crescent City has definitely left its mark on King\u2019s music. The singer, songwriter and guitarist specializes in the classic sounds of early folk, blues, rock n\u2019 roll and ragtime, played with soulful New Orleans flair.\nA seriously gifted musician with a degree in Jazz guitar from Michigan\u2019s prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy, King paid his dues by busking on the streets of New Orleans during his early days in Louisiana.  Since then he\u2019s shared stages with Jack White, Taj Mahal, Nickel Creek\u2019s Chris Thile and the Rebirth Brass Band.  Deftly mixing original material with songs from a bygone era, Luke Winslow-King brings his dynamic five-piece band to Liberty Plaza once again.\n\n\nAugust 13th - B\u00d8RNS w/s/g Chris Bathgate \nThe nom de plume of singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and Michigan native Garrett Borns, B\u00f8rns, crafts big-hearted, alternately dreamy and danceable, falsetto-driven electro-pop confections that have been dusted with glam rock and folk. Raised in the great lake coastal town of Grand Haven, Michigan, B\u00f8rns studied music at the Interlochen Center for the Arts and Grand Rapids Community College, while becoming a fixture in the local music scene. After a brief stint in New York City, B\u00f8rns decided to relocate to Los Angeles, where he set up shop in a self-described \"treetop sanctuary\" just outside of the city, and began honing what would eventually become his debut EP, the Interscope-issued Candy. His new single \u201cElectric Love\u201d is on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and in rotation on every rock station in America.  https://www.facebook.com/bornsmusic \nw/ Chris Bathgate,\nBathgate\u2019s signature country-tinged gothic folk has been perfectly honed in his latest critically acclaimed album Salt Year.  \nhttp://chrisbathgate.org \n\nAugust 20th - Theo Katzman w/ Joey Dosik \nA scholar from the prestigious University of Michigan Music School and multi-instrumentalist, Theo played drums, guitar, and the majority of the bass on his debut album Romance Without Finance.

Bacon's latest book, Endzone, with a reading by the author, Q&A, and signing at Rackham Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.\n\n***\n\nPre-order the book from us and, if you let us know in the 'comment' field, we can bring it to Rackham and have it ready for you on 9/1 for pick-up! \n\nhttp://www.literatibookstore.com/book/9781250078971 \n\n***\n\nEndzone tells the story of how college football's most successful, richest and respected program almost lost all three in less than a decade - and entirely of its own doing. It is a story of hubris, greed, and betrayal - a tale more suited to Wall Street than the world's top public university. \nAuthor John U. Bacon takes you inside the offices, the board rooms and the locker rooms of the University of Michigan to see what happened, and why - with countless eye-opening, head-shaking scenes of conflict and conquest. \n\nBut Endzone is also an inspiring story of redemption and revival. When those who loved Michigan football the most recognized it was being attacked from within, they rallied to reclaim the values that made it great for over a century -- values that went deeper than dollars.

Finally, drummer Darren King voiced what everyone was thinking, but feared saying out loud: either call it quits or swallow their individual pride and try to write the best songs they ever had. No one said a word at that point, recalls vocalist/frontman Paul Meany. And without comment, apology or agreeing, I just remember all of us walking right back inside, going straight to our instruments, and just starting to play music. That was the day King, Meany, guitarist Greg Hill, and bassist Roy Mitchell-C\u00e1rdenas began to write what would become Armistice.  But before that day would arrive, the band had written close to 16 songs in the midst of their 3 years on the road and had full intention of arriving in New Orleans to record and sculpt these ideas into the 10 or so songs they would need for their sophomore release. But after weeks of recording and working in every separate corner of an old uptown voodoo Victorian, the internal conflicts over what parts made up the best ideas began building to a full on creative stalemate.  Growing exhausted with their crumbling democracy, the band started looking for an outside producer to evaluate the situation. One by one, they were flown in every other day for a week until they met Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse, Elvis Costello, The Hives).\n\u201cWhat caught our attention about Dennis was that he had the most simple, yet slightly offensive suggestion for us,\u201d says Meany about their first visit. Upon hearing what had been recorded so far Herring said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just try writing some new songs?\nI\u2019m surprised no one had really entertained that option up until then, Meany comments, perhaps because it seemed like too daunting of a task considering how invested we\u2019d become in the existing ideas. But Herring continued to push his point, You obviously aren\u2019t happy with what you have, and honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great either. Stop spinning your wheels; shelve these songs; and start spending your time writing together. Don\u2019t worry about recording your record right now. Just write it.\u201d\nTaking a few days to think about it after Herring left, the band attempted a discussion on what to do next, but still could not come to any unanimous agreements until that noteworthy day on the front porch where all the conflict would come to a head.\nAll of the constant fighting had left us unable to resolve anything, remembers Mitchell-C\u00e1rdenas. But something special happened when we just decided to shut our mouths, pick up our instruments, and disregard anything we had written prior. Something began to align in the creative universe. Songs were forming on their own at a fast pace, almost as if their true sound was being discovered for the first time. It was in this moment that their first single Spotlight fell out of the sky.\nOnce the band had grasped the benefit of their new mindset, they didn\u2019t waste any more time. All previous 16 ideas were completely scrapped and the band began to work together in the same room everyday just starting with a tempo and key to play in. It turned into a marathon style writing session yielding a new song about every other day. The band eventually signed on Herring as their official producer and after 3 months in New Orleans shaping up almost 20 brand new songs, they headed to Oxford, MS and worked more closely with Herring to put the final details in place.  Fueled by the band\u2019s chaos and confusion, MUTEMATH has created a work of tremendous beauty and meaning on Armistice via such tracks as the hypnotic, musically inventive Clipping, the propulsive, high dynamic charge of The Nerve, the quirky tribute to Murphy\u2019s Law Backfire, and the nine-minute, soaring, closing opus Burden.  Instead of brushing aside the questions and anxiety that propelled the project\u2019s birth, the quartet embraces them, with each song questioning where to go from here.\nSince MUTEMATH released its first EP in late 2004 and hit the road in 2005, their inherent nature has challenged limitations and expanded parameters. By the time of the 2006 self-titled debut, their blending of adverse genres into its own innovative sonically adventurous creation earned them a reputation as one of modern music\u2019s most daring young groups. By 2007, they would find themselves Grammy nominated and declared by Alternative Press as the #1 band you need to see live before you die. But in the process of pushing boundaries even further for themselves, they almost pushed themselves out of existence. It was a risk we had to take, says King looking back on what they set out to accomplish for Armistice. This record was by far the most painful music-making experience I\u2019ve ever had, but also the one I\u2019m most proud of.\nIt\u2019s evident that this record is not a high-minded story with a beautiful resolve, but rather the experience of knowing when to stop fighting for the sake of progress. Without a doubt, ideals get mamed and dismembered in the scuffle, but Armistice emerges as a transcendent anesthetic to keep us singing and dancing through it all.", "date": "2015-09-19T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/441077436062198/", "name": "Mutemath 9/19/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "UMMA docents will guide visitors through the galleries on tours as diverse as their interests and areas of expertise.

The first decade was full of hope for a new social order that would reject the values and traditions of Tsarist rule. Centered in Moscow, a group of young artists, spearheaded in part by Vladimir (1899-1982) and Georgy Stenberg (1900-1933), championed an art that promoted the egalitarian ideals of the New Order and contributed to the growth of the Soviet Union. Known as the Constructivists, they advocated for utilitarian art that was easily accessible and spoke to the masses. Among their most provocative and visionary works were posters advertising Soviet films.\n\t\nUMMA\u2019s exhibition, Soviet Constructivist Posters: Branding the New Order features a selection of posters by the Stenbergs and other Constructivists for some of early cinema\u2019s most inventive films including, Sergei Eisenstein\u2019sOctober and Dziga Vertov\u2019s Man with a Movie Camera.\n\t\nUsing dynamic compositions, bold colors, and emblematic images, these posters announced that the Soviet Union was a progressive nation that could propel society into a utopian future. Their revolutionary aesthetic became associated with the workers\u2019 movement and helped to shape how it was understood both at home and abroad. Though Constructivism went out of favor in the 1930s with the rise of Joseph Stalin (1878\u20131953), Constructivist designs continued to have an influence abroad.

Heck, even they\u2019d cop to a few, like Ricky Nelson and The Clash. But once those same RIYL tags have been filtered through the minds and hands and voices of this five-piece, there\u2019s simply nothing else like it.\n\nThe Growlers took the phrase \u201cBeach Goth\u201d as an apt descriptor of their music. Sunburned and salty, that term perfectly describes their distinctive melding of reverb heavy surf guitar and Bakersfield-style honky tonk with \u201880s post-punk.\n\nThis is especially true of Chinese Fountain, The Growlers\u2019 fifth full-length set to be released on September 23rd via Everloving Records. The 11 songs found on it are some of the strongest that they\u2019ve committed to tape yet; a byproduct not only of eight years in the trenches together, but finely honing their gypsy folk dirges and psychedelic sea shanties to fans at close to 150 shows each year. The connection between vocalist Brooks Nielsen and guitarist Matt Taylor (the principal songwriters of the group) has only grown deeper.\n\n\u201cThe band played better than they\u2019ve ever played,\u201d says Nielsen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the process down now. There\u2019s less screwing around to get the songs laid out and we weren\u2019t waiting around for take after take. We knew it and we played without much time to spare.\u201d\nThat confidence bleeds through every track on Chinese Fountain, with the band assured enough to layer in shades of many new influences: the loping ska beat of \u201cDull Boy\u201d and \u201cGoing Gets Tuff,\u201d the playful disco beat behind the title track, or the Teardrop Explodes-like agitation of \u201cGood Advice.\u201d\n\nNot that the band left themselves much room to second-guess anything. The five spent about three weeks writing the tracks, and about half that time in the studio recording them. That may sound rushed, but it\u2019s not as if you can hear any strain on the finished product; Chinese Fountain is as rock solid and watertight as anything in their still-growing discography.\n\nThere\u2019s evolution to be heard in Chinese Fountain as well, courtesy of some of Nielsen\u2019s most pointed and poignant lyrics to date. He takes our obsession with the online world to task on the funky title track. When he drops the bomb that obliterates that most famous of Beatles\u2019 claims with \"The internet is bigger than Jesus or John Lennon\u201d he re-contextualizes Marshall McLuhan's \"the medium is the message\" in the same breath. He urges positivity no matter the obstacles (\u201cGoing Gets Tuff\u201d).

The record arrives October 9th via Anti-.\n\nThe first single, \u201cSleeper Hold\u201d is a pulsating and infectious rock song that utilizes elements of punk, folk and straight up rock and roll, all centered around a soaring and beautifully anthemic chorus.\n\nSuch Things is the anticipated follow up to Saintseneca\u2019s acclaimed album Dark Arc, which Stereogum celebrated writing, \u201cDark Arc shines in all the ways Saintseneca always has \u2014 gorgeous harmonies, rampant strumming, glimpses of both humanity\u2019s fragility and power \u2014 but it also finds the band branching out into fuller arrangements and wilder instrumentation.

I think the best work I\u2019ll make involves working that way.\u201d\n\nThose disparate pieces and parts have come together, like so many molecules, to form a solid rock object called Such Things.

Rapper AK started rapping at 11 years old and his partner Issa Gold started 6 years ago. Raised together in Flatbush, Brooklyn, they established THE UNDERACHIEVERS in 2011 and have been creating music together ever since. In May 2012, the group released their debut video for \"So Devilish\" and everything began to take off from there. Since then, the group has gained more than 24 million views on YouTube, 125,000+ YouTube subscribers and solid reviews from all of the top music publications. The Underachievers released the critically acclaimed INDIGOISM in February of 2013. The debut mix tape received an eight out of ten from Pitchfolk.com and has since gone PLATINUM on DatPiff. The mix tape has been downloaded over 300k times and has accumulated over 745k views on the unique website. It has been heralded as one of the best projects of 2013 and it has served as an excellent tool to establish the reputation of the group. In August of 2013, UA released their second project \"The Lords of Flatbush\" produced entirely by the extraordinary producer LEX LUGER. Again the mix tape was released on DatPiff and it amassed over 155k downloads making it a GOLD release on the site. In 2014, the group headlined their first tour \u201cEyes of the World\u201d across North America, Canada & Europe. In August of the same year, UA also released their debut album on the RPM MSC label entitled \"Cellar Door: Terminus Ut Exordium\". The album charted #16 on R&B/Hip-Hop Album chart, #12 on INDI Album chart, #11 on Rap Album chart and #86 on the Billboard 200 album chart in its first week. The main purpose of UA\u2019s music is to aide in the enlightenment of their generation by providing music from a perspective that all can appreciate and enjoy but still keeping it positive and as \"true to hip hop\" as they can. By combining their strong points they have been able to establish themselves as a rising reputable force in Hip Hop and the music Industry. The Underachievers wrapped up 2014 with a co-headline tour across North America & Canada joining Flatbush Zombies for a jaunt dubbed \"Clockwork Indigo Presents The Electric Koolade Experience\".

They sought to make the kind of music they wanted to hear and in the process created something uniquely their own.\n\nBy 1995 they released their self-titled debut and toured the underground scene in nonstop support of their work, playing everywhere from basements and coffee shops to Gilman Street with bands such as Knapsack, Giant\u2019s Chair, and Christie Front Drive. The following year brought further collaboration with Front Drive in a split 10\u201d. With a growing fan base in an emerging genre, they were ready to create their second album, Departures and Landfalls.\n\nWhile on tour, the band became a tighter unit and developed focus by talking about music and planning their future creative direction. They all saw Departures as their first opportunity to document new songs that could help define an original sound. With stronger songcraft, a refined tone, and a solid creative process, the work they created remained abrasive but also incorporated warmth and depth.\n\nGeography and seasons affected the process; some songs were written on the road, with an ever-changing landscape, and many during the springtime and early summer. Late nights of long drives, longer talks, and doing what you love are what made Departures Boys Life\u2019s first real record, full of new but classic sounds. They had made something of their own.\n\nDuring five days of a hot summer in Chicago in 1996, they recorded with Bob Weston in the home studio of Steve Albini. In the band\u2019s maturity, they were rehearsing almost daily and decided to record the album live. Several first takes made the final cut, and the resulting songs sounded natural and organic, reflecting the true dynamic of the band and their live performance.\n\nAfter the record\u2019s release, Boys Life co-headlined tours with Kerosene 454 and Bluetip. Their performances were loud, enthusiastic, and genuine, and the experience strengthened the band\u2019s newfound bonds with those in DC sharing the same postpunk ethic. By the end of that touring cycle, however, citing exhaustion, they called it a day in the summer of 1997.\n\nNow, nearly twenty years later, Boys Life is ready to revisit their records with renewed energy. Both the band and their songs were products of a special time that can\u2019t be replicated, only revisited. But then and now, both Boys Life and Departures and Landfalls reflect something more than nostalgia\u2014creativity, the power of music, the roar of a thunderstorm, and the lonesome sound of a train whistle.", "date": "2015-10-19T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/398616826996922/", "name": "Boys Life 10/19/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Sat.

Some singers are devoted to the pursuit of perpetual motion, and Langhorne Slim releases his wild soul in ways that come out of the discipline of live performance.\n\nThe 13 songs that compose Langhorne Slim & The Law's new \"The Way We Move\" are road-tested, rollicking and very rock 'n' rolling tunes that the songwriter perfected with his loyal band, and come out of the kind of good times and bad experiences that songwriters of Langhorne's lofty stature can turn into life-affirming rock 'n' roll. You could also call what Langhorne Slim does folk music, but then there's his sly, charming and open-hearted feel for pop music -- those summertime melodies that nudge you into a grin even when the song is about something bad.\n\nFor Langhorne Slim -- Pennsylvania-born self-taught guitarist who moves to Brooklyn at 18, begins feeling out his place in a burgeoning punk-folk scene, wends his way to the West Coast, and finds himself celebrated from Newport to Portland as one of today's most original singers and songwriters -- \"The Way We Move\" represents the sound of a band devoted to living in the moment. Riding the success of his 2009 full-length Be Set Free, Langhorne went through some changes over the last three years -- he lost his beloved grandfather, who is the subject of the new record's moving \"Song for Sid,\" and moved on from a relationship that had lasted five years.\n\nAnd there was the physical moving -- the literal side of the record's title. Pulling up stakes from his home of two years, Portland, Ore., Langhorne also has been touring non-stop with The Law. As he says, \"I'm in a bit of a transitional period -- currently, the road will be home. That's just kind of my spirit, to be slightly restless.\" Perfecting their rangy sound out on the endless grey ribbon, Langhorne and The Law -- bassist Jeff Ratner, drummer Malachi DeLorenzo and banjo player and keyboardist David Moore -- went down to rural Texas in the summer of 2011 to work on new material. With some 30 tunes to consider, the quartet soaked up the Lone Star sunshine and developed arrangements and approaches for Langhorne's latest batch of songs.", "date": "2015-10-24T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/843147115782248/", "name": "Langhorne Slim & The Law 10/24/15 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Monday, October 26 | 9pm | 18+ | $12 adv./ $14 day of\n\nTelekinesis - We've all heard plenty about the astonishing debut and the \"difficult\" sophomore release.

The charging, anthemic \u201cRaise a Little Hell,\u201d also the set\u2019s first video, lays out the band\u2019s live modus operandi, thriving on Bussell\u2019s and Breezy\u2019s chugging beat and the Rev.\u2019s resonator guitar riffs and mantra-like singing. The song was inspired by a show at a folk festival, where one of the promoters \u2014 struck by the Big Damn Band\u2019s raucous, juke joint power \u2014 told the Rev., \u201cY\u2019all sure raise a lot of hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Naw we don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201c the Rev. recalls. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe we do raise a little hell.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sweet, joyful \u201cPot Roast & Kisses,\u201d which the band has also committed to video, was written for Breezy. The Rev. was developing the finger-busting main riff after enjoying one of her pot roast dinners when the lyrics naturally fell into place. \u201cSome people don\u2019t believe that we really live the way we sing about in our songs,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut it\u2019s true.

This charming story centers around a headphones-sporting robot on the verge of obsolescence who falls in love with a lonely office girl. This live adaptation unfolds via real-time filming of more than a dozen miniature stages and a cast of puppets, while Kid Koala and the Aelos Quartet provide original live scoring on piano, strings, and turntables. The result? You\u2019ll seem to be watching an animated picture, but simultaneously seeing puppets being filmed and projected in real time.
