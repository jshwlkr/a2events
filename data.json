Joining Julie will be Gloria Thomas, director of the Center for the Education of Women at the University of Michigan, for a post-reading conversation.\n\nHow does graduate admissions work? Who does the system work for, and who falls through its cracks? More people than ever seek graduate degrees, but little has been written about who gets in and why. Drawing on firsthand observations of admission committees and interviews with faculty in 10 top-ranked doctoral programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, education professor Julie Posselt pulls back the curtain on a process usually conducted in secret.\n\nInside Graduate Admissions presents admissions from a decision maker\u2019s point of view, including thought-provoking episodes of committees debating the process, interviewing applicants, and grappling with borderline cases. Who ultimately makes the admit list reveals as much about how professors see themselves and each other as it does about how they view students. Professors in these programs say that they admit on merit, but they act on different meanings of the term. Disciplinary norms shape what counts as merit, as do professor\u2019s ideas about intelligence and their aversions to risk, conflict, ambiguity, and change. Professors also say that they seek diversity, but Posselt shows that their good intentions don t translate into results. In fact, faculty weigh diversity in only a small fraction of admissions decisions. Often, they rely upon criteria that keep longstanding inequalities in place.\n\nMore equitable outcomes occur when admissions committees are themselves diverse and when members take a fresh look at inherited assumptions that affect their judgment. To help academic departments promote transparency and accountability, Posselt closes with concrete strategies to improve admissions review.\n\nJulie Posselt is Assistant Professor of Higher Education at the University of Michigan.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/446791705531102/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-01-11T19:00:00-05:00", "name": "Julie Posselt w/ Gloria Thomas"}, {"description": "Monday, January 11, 2016, 7:30 pm\nHill Auditorium\n\nFounded by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra made its UMS debut in 1950 and last performed in Hill Auditorium in 1992.

His mother left him an apartment and a debit card, from which he withdraws money every day to purchase a drink at Starbucks. Until Rus is told by a government agency that his apartment is illegal and that he owes taxes. Lots of taxes. Rus panics and his cash is stolen by a smooth talking Russian submarine captain.\n\nMeanwhile, as Rus capitulates to the demands of society and finds an office job with the help of a micro-managing new girlfriend, the neighborhood's local postal worker surveys the lives of its other residents with an omniscient eye: Mrs. Blue compulsively steals hand creams; a secretary struggles to make conversation (much less human connections); a delivery man desperately seeks to make a name for himself but struggles with his immigrant status; and an aging bachelor, hampered by extreme paranoia, will finally have the chance to meet the Queen (if he can just hold it together long enough).\n\nWith Rus at the head of this lonely ensemble's search for meaning in a complicated and alienating world, debut novelist Adriaanse weaves together intersecting lives to create a mini-epic, one that charts a hidden resistance to corporate sameness and artificial relationships.\n\n\"Bette Adriaanse has concocted a blend of \"Rear Window\" and \"Under Milk Wood,\" a world in which various inhabitants of a neighborhood are not only observed but intimately known by a girl with a blonde ponytail whose task is to deliver post. The episodes are brief, short hooks in the narrative to increase the mystery. The whole is elegant and tantalizing.\" --George Szirtes, T.S. Eliot Prize winning author of Reel\n\n\"In the lives of Rus and the other 'ordinary' characters around him, Bette Adriaanse has created something quite extraordinary. Drawing on the best European traditions of the fabulous and the absurd, she has invented a shimmering narrative world which is entirely her own - hallucinatory, dream-like and utterly real. Told with verve and wit, warmth and deep pathos, Rus Like Everyone Else is a highly original contemporary fable for our times: Adriaanse's is a singular new vision and voice and one we are surely going to hear more of.\" --Jane Draycott, author of The Night Tree\n\nBette Adriaanse is a writer and a visual artist. She was born in Amsterdam in 1984. Bette graduated from the Image and Language department at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam in 2008 and received her M.A. in creative writing from Oxford University in 2010.

January 16 | 9pm | 18+ | $14 Cover\n\nChrome Sparks is the solo project of Jeremy Malvin, a Brooklyn transplant from Pittsburgh by way of Ann Arbor. In 2014, after having self released a small handful of singles and two EPs on Bandcamp, Malvin signed to the taste making Sydney based label Future Classic. Under the new label, he rereleased Sparks EP and released the Goddess EP. His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers. FADER has described his music as \u2018form-shifting beats [that] seem to resonate with spaced-out chillers and hyperactive party kids alike\u2019.\n\nIn 2012, while on Warped Tour as the drummer for Stepdad, Malvin released the slow burning, bass heavy single \u201cMarijuana\u201d on a Bandcamp compilation highlighting music from he and his friends in Ann Arbor. It quickly rocketed to #1 on Hype Machine and has since become an internet-stoner anthem. It has subsequently been rereleased by Future Classic and Kitsun\u00e9.\n\nHis upcoming release, Parallelism, was made using sounds from three analog synthesizers, vocal samples from friends, and a tambourine.\n\nWSG: Moon Diagrams - https://soundcloud.com/geonorth/moon-diagrams-scratch-the-snow-edit\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/578", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1390235697944662/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-01-16T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Chrome Sparks w/ Moon Diagrams 1/16/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Restaurant Week is your opportunity to try as many great Ann Arbor restaurants as your schedule allows for one incredibly low fixed price. $15 for lunch and $28 for a three course dinner with many restaurants offering 2 for 1 pricing!\n\nCheck out www.annarborrestaurantweek.com for participating restaurants and menu offerings!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1657867854492206/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-01-17T11:00:00-05:00", "name": "Ann Arbor Restaurant Week"}, {"description": "This is Nicola\u2019s Books first winter Local Authors Event where we can showcase local authors to the community.

January 23 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nMatthew Dear - Depending on whom you ask, Matthew Dear is a DJ, a dance-music producer, an experimental pop artist, a bandleader. He co-founded both Ghostly International and its dancefloor offshoot, Spectral Sound. He\u2019s had remixes commissioned by The XX, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Spoon, Hot Chip, The Postal Service, and Chemical Brothers; He\u2019s made mixes for Get Physicals Body Language and Fabric mix series. He maintains four aliases (Audion, False, Jabberjaw, and Matthew Dear), each with its own style and distinct visual identity. He straddles multiple musical worlds and belongs to none and he\u2019s just hitting his stride.\n\nMatthew Dear\u2019s 2003 full-length debut, Leave Luck to Heaven, is a suite of sparse, wickedly funky house laced with Dear\u2019s deep, distinctive vocals, and includes the much-loved single Dog Days (voted one of Pitchforks Top 100 Songs of the Decade). The record was met with rapturous acclaim from both the dance-music establishment and the critical press, including a four-star review in Rolling Stone. The 2007 follow-up, Asa Breed, is a considerable departure from Heavens dancefloor excursions, incorporating the polyrhythms of Afrobeat, the irreverent pop sensibilities of Brian Eno, and the austere beauty of Krautrock. More four-stars reviews followed, and Dear subsequently began touring with a live three-piece band, Matthew Dear\u2019s Big Hands, in which Dear acted as frontman, commanding the stage with a Bryan Ferry-like swagger and a gentlemans grace.\n\n2010 saw the release of Dear\u2019s watershed third album, Black City, a darkly playful sound-world that envelops the listener like the arms of a malevolent lover. Black City was met with near-unanimous critical praise, earning top marks from Mojo, Uncut, Q, URB, and the Village Voice, ending up on countless year-end lists, and earning Pitchfork\u2019s coveted Best New Music nod. A worldwide tour followed, in which Dear and a newly expanded band continued to hone their live chops with vicious focus.\n\nMatthew Dear\u2019s latest full-length, 2012\u2019s Beams, is both a drastic departure from and worthy successor to Black City\u2019s gothic masterwork. A suite of weird, wild, and queasily optimistic rhythm-driven pop songs, Beams is the latest chapter in the continuing evolution of one of music\u2019s most fascinating minds. After over a decade of exploring pops outer limits, Matthew Dear now inhabits a rarified corner of the musical universe: no longer tethered to any one genre, respected by his peers, and blessed with a bottomless well of creative energy. Now is Matthew Dear\u2019s moment, and it sounds like nothing else.\n\nOn stage, Matthew Dear performs with a multi-pieced live band, unraveling the tightly wound album tracks into kaleidoscopic walls of sound. They have supported Interpol, Hot Chip and Depeche Mode on their world tours, and have performed sold-out shows from London to New York City.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/643718722398474/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-01-23T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Matthew Dear (DJ Set) 1/23/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "America's single bloodiest day was at the Battle of Antietam, and Michigan played a prominent role.

Encouraged by Mick, she traveled to Ireland numerous times, where she enjoyed further opportunities to play with and learn from the many fantastic musicians that country has to offer. She's also been fortunate to learn from great players on this side of the Atlantic as well, such as Seamus Connolly and Brian Conway among many others. Kelsey moved to Chicago in 2013, where she quickly became part of the city's vibrant music scene. She is now an accomplished teacher and performer, playing regularly with the Crossroads Ceili band. She also enjoys playing at local sessions and ceilis, as well as traveling to perform throughout the United States. \n\nSean Gavin\u2019s playing on the flute and uilleann pipes reflects his lifelong immersion in and love for traditional Irish music. Encouraged by his father, Clare fiddler Mick Gavin, Sean played a variety of  instruments until settling on the flute at age eleven. He was inspired by Scariff flute player Leo MacNamara who moved to Sean's hometown of Detroit in the late 1990s. Not long after, he began work on the uilleann pipes with late teacher Al Purcell\u2014himself a student of famed piper Leo Rowsome. Currently residing in Chicago, Sean has had the great fortune to spend time with Sligo flute legend Kevin Henry.

February 19 | 9pm | 18+ | $12 adv./ $14 Day of\n\nMustard Plug with The Vulnerable [https://www.facebook.com/thevulnerable ] &  1592\n\nMustard Plug started out in the punk clubs, basements and dive bars of the Midwest, playing punk-influenced ska music before most people in the U.S. had ever heard of ska. They clung to a DIY work ethic that had been ingrained in them growing up in the 1980\u2032s hardcore punk scene and applied it to everything they would ever do together as a band. Mustard Plug released their first cassette tape themselves (1992\u2032s Skapocalypse Now!), and played constantly to earn enough money to record their first album \u2013 1994\u2032s Big Daddy Mulititude. Their debut full length was released on legendary NYC label Moon Records (home of Toasters, Hepcat, Dance Hall Crashers, and pretty much every other 90\u2032s ska band of note). With their new found national distribution and exposure, the band climbed into their van and performed their music to new fans across North America. Twenty-one years, 1500 shows and 200,000 album sales later, it cannot be denied that the band has surpassed all expectations and permanently staked their claim in contemporary music.\n\nFor their new album, \u201cCan\u2019t Contain It\u201d, Mustard Plug have returned to the DIY blueprint that the band was built upon, while at the same time embracing all the school of hard knocks craftsmanship and wisdom that the band has earned along the way. The band spent the last several years writing new material that was informed by 22 years of songwriting experience while retaining the youthful energy that has endeared them to their fans. They tracked the record at bassist Rick Johnson\u2019s Cold War Studios, giving them the flexibility to experiment and add new layers and dimensions that were not possible given the time constraints on their previous recordings. Many of their musician friends(Dan Potthast, Sean Bonnett, Mark Petz, Corey Ruffin) were tapped to contribute, creating a denser, more intricate sound.\n\nOnce the recording process for Can\u2019t Contain It was complete, the band turned to their fans to help finance the mixing and production of their record. Their Kickstarter campaign surpassed all their expectations, doubling their initial goal and re-confirming the support and love of their audience. The tracks were then sent to be mixed at Bill Stevenson\u2019s Blasting Room Studios where Mustard Plug had recorded 3 of their previous albums (including 1997\u2019s breakthrough \u201cEvildoers Beware\u201d and 2007\u2019s \u201cIn Black and White\u201d). The result is possibly their most diverse and best record to date.\n\nAfter tapping their friends and fans to help out with the recording, the band turned to more of their posse to collaborate on the artwork. Underground icon Jeff Rosenstock designed the album packaging, while noted artists Craig Horkey and Larry Kole created alternative limited edition album covers and posters. The final piece came together when at the last minute, No Idea record founder, Var Thelin heard the record and offered to partner with the band on its release. Mustard Plug is excited to be given the opportunity to collaborate with a label known for its\u2019 strong punk rock ethics and underground credibility.\n\nUltimately, this release is about the community Mustard Plug has built during its\u2019 22 year existence. Coming full circle back to the DIY scene and the community that the were born out of has helped them to put out their best record to date.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/510894402424469/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-02-19T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Mustard Plug, The Vulnerable & 1592 2/19/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Tell your friends!

March 5 | 9pm | $15 Cover | 18+\n\nElectric Six -  Mortality. It\u2019s the primary reason we don\u2019t live forever. If not for our mortality, the number of years each of us would have to roam this earth would be as infinite as the sands of time running through the earth itself. When extraterrestrials eventually make first contact with us within the next twenty years, the first glaringly obvious thing they will notice\u2026is that we die. They will come to our planet with sinister intentions and they will immediately have the upper hand because we die\u2026and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a simple as that. And it\u2019s all because of our mortality.\n\nWhile aliens (and the government!!!!!) will always be there to kill us, we have for generations used our cold dead hands to clutch onto whatever silver lining we could sew into the dark cloud of our everlasting mortality. Specifically, we tell ourselves that we can live forever, not in corporeal form, but through our creations of art\u2026and our expressions of love.\n\nThusly, art and love are more important than ever, because they are now the conduits that preserve our life forces. If you don\u2019t create art and you don\u2019t love nobody\u2026well then, you will be forgotten, rather quickly. No one wants to be forgotten rather quickly. No one more so\u2026than Electric Six.\n\nElectric Six understands all this stuff as it prepares to unveil its eleventh studio album Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, which will be released on October 6 on Metropolis Records. The album is steeped in themes of mortality, death, discorporation and discoloration\u2026all while it tries to convince you it is actually a work of art, a labour of love.\n\nFrom the pounding, driving opener, \u201cDrone Strikes\u201d, through the 1970s guitar anthem \u201cTwo Dollar Two\u201d, Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die! reveals that Electric Six knows that it is going to die, but will not go out quietly. From there, the album moves through the pop goodness of \u201cKids Are Evil\u201d and \u201cA Variation of Elaine\u201d, the prog-rock showmanship of \u201cSlow Motion Man\u201d, and even a tribute to Elvis Presley in his more rotund years with \u201cDime Dime Penny Dime\u201d.\n\n\u201cBig Red Arthur\u201d is the anchor track of the album, as it emits a rock-opera bombast that is reminiscent of Radiohead sodomizing David Bowie in the center of his mind. It, like most of the songs on this record, is about death\u2026but it\u2019s kind of funny because it\u2019s only about the death of a fake, out-of-shape drunk Santa Claus who is too fucking stupid to make it down the chimney correctly. In this case, we just end up laughing at death. And that\u2019s uplifting.\n\nTo summarize, mortality is everywhere, and this fall, thanks to their new record Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die!, Electric Six will be everywhere too. Everybody gonna die someday, but with Electric Six\u2019s new album, you no longer have to worry about any of it. Bitch, Don\u2019t Let Me Die is Electric Six\u2019s brand new record for 2015 and it is available on Metropolis Records on Oct. 2. You can come see Electric Six play in your town on the I Wanna Lick The Screen tour, starting in their home state of Michigan on Sept. 25.\n\nWSG: Parlour Tricks", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/998925893483957/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-03-05T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Electric Six w/ Parlour Tricks 3/5/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "One day at a time, discover colorful Motor City moments in history spanning more than three centuries.

He has returned home to the Bay Area after living in Los Angeles these past three years, and is self-producing his new album with help from friends in Berkeley and San Francisco. The Zombie Dinosaur LP revisits the satirical, funny, uptempo style of Lars\u2019 2004 debut album, the Laptop EP. It features guest appearances by Watsky, Kool Keith, and Less than Jake\u2019s Roger Lima. Zombie Dinosaur tackles such topics as postfeminism, in a nod to Game of Thrones (\u201cDragon Blood\u201d); disappointing reunion bands with very few of their original members (\u201cSublime with Rome is Not the Same thing as Sublime\u201d); hipster parenting (\u201cHipster Mom\u201d); and the current state of EDM (\u201cSigning Dubstep\u201d). The project was funded entirely by Lars\u2019s third highly successful Kickstarter campaign, through which he raised over $42k to create and release Zombie Dinosaur under his own label, Horris Records. In the ten years that have followed his debut release, the Laptop EP, Lars has independently produced and released three other solo full-length albums, four EPs, and a number of mixtapes. He has collaborated with KRS-One, mentored and helped develop the career of fellow Stanford alum K.Flay (with whom he collaborated on the 2009 Single and Famous EP), opened for Nas and Snoop Dogg, and played multiple summers on the Vans Warped Tour. He has also headlined club shows across the US and in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Lars has spoken and presented at two different TEDx conferences, performed at Carnegie Hall with a live string section (at Scholastic\u2019s 2012 Art and Writing Awards \u2013 where he debuted the video for his song, \u201cFlow Like Poe,\u201d which is the lead single on his 2012 Edgar Allan Poe EP). Lars has developed and grown Horris Records in this past decade, signing the label\u2019s first artist, Weerd Science (the solo hip-hop project of Cohered & Cambria\u2019s drummer, Josh Eppard). Lars has continued to produce music videos for himself and his friends, including a cameo credit on past musical collaborator \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic\u2019s 2014 \u201cLame Claim to Fame\u201d (for which Lars was given a special shout out in the liner notes to Al\u2019s Grammy Award winning album, Mandatory Fun). Having been labeled as one of the pioneers of the underground \u201cnerdcore hip-hop\u201d subgenre, Lars has recently expanded from the studio to the classroom. With visiting scholar/teacher residencies at USC, and in the UK, and across the US in Nantucket, Florida, California, Alaska, and Kansas, Lars has found joy in educating young people about \u201clit-hop,\u201d a subject term he coined to highlight the connections between literature, classical poetry, and the cultural history of rap. Lars has continued to work closely with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, teaching workshops on preventing self-harm, and positive ways to use music as creative therapy for depression. He has also worked with the American Heart Association, promoting youth heart health. It\u2019s been quite a decade.

The loss of a life, a love, a job, a home, will shake our foundation and we will inevitably crumble.  We then consider ourselves defeated; disheartened and utterly broken. But there is power in the acknowledgment of brokenness.\n\nNever Not Broken is taken from the Hindu Goddess Akhilanda or the 'Always Broken Goddess'. \"Akhilanda derives her power from being broke: in flux, pulling herself apart, living in different selves [and states of being] at the same time, from never becoming a whole that has limitations.\" (*1)\n\n\"Fluid connections, the celebration of ambiguity and a sense of ritual in chaos... deeply invested in the notion of complexity, this work will explore the arena of [brokenness] as an entree to rapture.  Artists working in this mode push the deconstruction and dissolution of centre, definitions and boundaries to reach the sublime terror [and beauty] of placelessness [and brokenness]\" *(2)\n\nBrokenness is not indicative of weakness or inability, but rather can be a strong driving force towards creative output as a means of analysis, internalizing, and coping for many artists.  This show seeks work that was created from a state of, and acknowledges our, Never Not Brokenness.\n\n(*1) Excerpt from the online article Why Lying Broken in a Pile on Your Bedroom Floor is a Good Idea by Julie Peters, Elephant Journal\n\n(*2) Excerpt from the Essay Beneath the Remains by Shamin M.

So we decided to just do it quick and dirty, old-school style. Like the open mic nights I used to play: unamplified guitar and vocals, friends with their axes playing along, arrangements arrived at on the fly and infinitely flexible. Four songs later we felt really inspired\u2014me and Matt played a song or two without anybody else around because we\u2019d gotten down to the basement before the others, the total song choice was strictly \u201cwhat do you figure we should play now?\u201d, the mood was relaxed and free\u2026we loved it. Later that night, we decided to strip down the drum kit to essentials and play a choke-the-motor set echoing and elaborating on what we\u2019d done downstairs: a sort of small-ensemble feel, lower in volume but actually higher in intensity. Like what we do in concentrate. It was one of our two favorite performances of the year, the other being the second night at the Fillmore. It felt like acres of new terrain opening up atop an ancient foundation. As soon as it was over, we all wanted to do it again. So in 2016 we\u2019re taking that set on the road. Not that exact set, obviously; the particulars will vary from night to night. But smaller rooms, audible frequencies, up close and personal: this is the general plan. Making eye contact with people in the back row, being able to go off-mic when I want to and still be heard. Total visibility. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this tour.

Almost 40 years later, at show after show, the song continues to be embraced by faithful followers and new fans alike.\nSince 1971, Jonathan has released 15 albums, including Blue Ridge, his standard-setting collaboration with bluegrass favorites the Seldom Scene, and Little Hands, his collection of children\u2019s songs, which was honored with a National Library Association award.\nwww.jonathanedwards.net", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1943009162591226/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-22T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Jonathan Edwards at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "A blues and boogie summit!

The saxophonist was embraced by the jazz mainstream on the release of 1994\u2019s Moodswing, and he\u2019s been both a critical and commercial favorite ever since. The Bad Plus, by contrast, have courted controversy since the release of their 2003 major label debut, These Are the Vistas. But when Joshua Redman joined the idiosyncratic trio as a special guest a few years back, a brilliant collaboration was born.

Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of her life in song has long appealed to those listeners who crave authenticity. Now, five years coming, she shares with us another powerful entry in her life\u2019s work, her sixth release, the aptly titled, Backin the Ring. Chris\u2019s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She\u2019s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet,Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She\u2019s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, TheLumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling nearly 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records. Chris\u2019s journey in music mirrors her path toward self-discovery. At 16, writing songs became a way of journaling. \u201cI was shy and introverted, and songwriting was a very personal process. I never had any intention of performing,\u201d she shares. Post high school, she went on to complete a biology degree at Wesleyan University, and afterwards, worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College. Meanwhile, she established a music career parallel to her biology work through touring and issuing a clutch of well-received indie releases.In 2006, when Chris found herself turning down too many opportunities as a musician, she shifted her priorities to become a full-time artist. Her latest album, Backin the Ring, is Chris\u2019s first studio full length since 2010\u2019s critically acclaimedHow I Learned to See in the Dark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in releasing songs I can\u2019t get behind or records I don\u2019t love,\u201d she says of the five-year span between albums. The title of her latest playfully suggests something of an artistic comeback, but it also references the album\u2019s themes of relationship conflict and making the decision to fight back against dark inner demons. \u201cMy music is the outward expression of the work I\u2019m doing internally. What I do comes from my experiences, and I strive to express these experiences authentically. Speaking my truth, and being myself, is the way that I connect with people,\u201d Chris confides. Her rise as an esteemed artist with captivating emotional integrity has been organic and always on her own terms.For someone who never had an intention of being a professional musician, it\u2019s been a life of far-reaching changes and unexpected rewards. \n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/595", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1318721681600135/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-28T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Chris Pureka 4/28/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "Michigan's cult hero of comedy", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/480751802102134/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-29T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Heywood Banks"}, {"description": "Don Campbell is a contemporary/country crossover and folk-rock singer/songwriter whose clear and well-delivered presentation of music supports the story in the song and welcomes the audience on board for the ride.

The band consists of Jeanne Mackey, Tom Voiles, Linda Teaman, and Laz Slomovits. The name Harmony Bones comes from an acupuncture point that harmonizes imbalances and promotes clear thinking, seeing, and hearing.\nJeanne, Tom, Linda and Laz have joined forces to explore a wide range of traditional, contemporary and original folk songs. Rich vocal harmonies and an array of instruments -- guitar, mandolin, flute, pennywhistle, fiddle, banjo, percussion, sitar -- combine to make Harmony Bones.\nSinger/songwriter Jeanne Mackey offers a blend of emotional intensity, wry humor, and global consciousness. In addition to original tunes, her repertoire ranges from Dar Williams to Patsy Cline, from Pete Seeger to Irving Berlin. A seasoned guitarist, she draws on a variety of styles -- folk, classic swing, funky blues, and more -- with the occasional sprinkle of mandolin, accordion, or banjo. Mackey rocked the 1970s East Coast topical music circuit as a young musician advocating feminist values and social justice.  In 2010, Mackey created \"Drop The Knife: A Memoir-in-Song,\" an evening of original songs and stories exploring the meaning of homeland, curses, death, and magic.\nLinda Teaman and Tom Voiles do much of their singing and playing with Nutshell, an Ann Arbor-based Celtic roots band. Nutshell plays for contra-dances and performs at festivals across North America.\nLinda is a singer who brings depth of understanding, warmth and sensitivity to the music. In 2005, her graduation recital for a degree in k-12 choral music had her singing in five languages, encompassing musical forms such as Irish sean nos singing and Italian and German arias by composers Purcell, Mozart and Brahms. She leads the Rudolf Steiner Community Singers, a small choir that sings uncommon Christmas and seasonal songs of celebration.  She hopes you'll forgive her classical background and that she is redeemed by her love of folk music.  In addition to vocals, she adds light percussion to the mix.\nTom consumes a well-rounded musical diet that ranges from Celtic to Indian to rock and roll. He enjoys mixing different styles while maintaining a respect for the traditions from which they spring. Tom has studied North Indian Classical music, Moroccan folk drumming and western classical flute. He has worked with performance artists, dancers, mimes and poets, including Hosain Mosavat, Gerry the Fool, Matthew Smith, ML Liebler and the Magic Poetry Band.\nLaz Slomovits is one of the twin brothers in Ann Arbor\u2019s nationally-known children\u2019s music duo, Gemini. A fine singer and multi-instrumentalist, Laz is starting his 41st year playing music. His songs are featured in songbooks used by music teachers throughout the country, and Gemini's recordings have won numerous awards. In addition, Laz has had a notable solo career. In his solo work, Laz is best known for his powerful musical settings of the poetry of ancient Sufi mystics Rumi and Hafiz, as well as that of contemporary American poets. He is currently at work on new recordings for both children and adults, as well as a musical play that will be produced by Wild Swan Theater in its upcoming season.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1637106023218709/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-13T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Harmony Bones at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "The ears and eyes of America!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1080836985282330/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-15T19:30:00-04:00", "name": "The Corn Potato String Band"}, {"description": "http://www.patdonohue.com/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/148870615480384/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-20T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Pat Donahue at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"description": "\"The best live performer I've ever seen\"\u2014John Mayer", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/200517660293245/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-21T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Martin Sexton"}, {"description": "Finding the point where blues and the jam bands meet", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1513930968936295/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-26T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Nick Moss"}, {"description": "A direct link to the early days of folk and the blues", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1698056820481625/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-10T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Josh White Jr."}, {"description": "October Project's lead vocalist returns", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/927935930621496/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-11T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Mary Fahl"}, {"description": "Newfound Road's amazing lead vocalist steps out with music by Jackson Browne and more.
