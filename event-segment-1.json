HSHV accepts and distributes 40,000 pounds of pet food each year, and we're grateful for the work they do as well as their participation in this event. Food donations, as well as donations by cash or check, will be accepted at the event, or you can donate online. \n\nNow regarded as a classic in dog literature, Ken Foster's memoir chronicles his journey from first-time dog owner to rescuer\u2014and all the lessons and mistakes he made along the way. Bookended by the tragedies of 9/11 and Katrina, Foster finds that dogs open his eyes to the benefits of compassion, selflessness, and the chaotic beauty of living each day in the moment. \n\nBut more than Foster's own story, readers remember the dogs. Among them are Duque, a Costa Rican stray; Brando, Foster's first adopted dog and a supposed pit bull mix who outgrew his Manhattan studio apartment; Rocco, a clownish red pit bull whose owner mistakenly gives him away to the wrong person; Zephyr, a cheerful Rottweiler mix who awakens Foster by sitting on his chest when his heart stops working; and Sula, the tiny lost pit bull who showed up at Foster's door one day and stayed. \n\nWhether bearing witness to national tragedy, grieving the death of a friend, or dealing with his own mortality, Foster finds strength in his dogs, and in the reciprocal nature of rescue. \n\n\"Generosity and gratitude power this compelling account of the reciprocal nature of rescue. Ken Foster illuminates a profound lesson about saving a life: Doing it makes you able to do it.\"\u2013Amy Hempel, author of The Dog of the Marriage and Reasons to Live\n\nKen Foster is the editor of two anthologies, including Dog Culture, and the author of Dogs I Have Met and I\u2019m a Good Dog. His collection of short stories, The Kind I'm Likely to Get, was a New York Times Notable Book. His work has appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The San Francisco Chronicle, McSweeney's, and The Believer. He has taught at The New School, Florida State University, and the University of Southern Mississippi.
