Each of its three sessions investigate critical social changes produced by war: in Ann Arbor, the far-reaching effects of the G.I. Bill in expanding higher education to an entire generation of men; in Willow Run the profound influence of female and African American employment in defense industries alongside a personal testament evoked by the mammoth, now empty buildings; in Detroit the ripples of musical exchange that ran alongside racial, religious, and ethnic conflict. The three sessions draw upon a lively mix of scholars, artists, and musicians, who, in turn, explore the unprecedented mixing that characterized wartime America.\nSymposium schedule:\n\n2 \u20134 p.m. Ann Arbor: \"The GI Bill and Its Impact on Higher Education,\" featuring lectures by Glenn Altschuler and Philo Hutcheson.\n\n4 \u20134:15 p.m. Visit UMMA exhibition Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory\n\n\n4:15\u20136:30 p.m. \"Willow Run: Gender, Race, and Factory Work During and After World War II,\" featuring Ernestine Ruben, her collaborator composer Stephen Hartke, UMMA Assistant Curator of Photography Jennifer Friess, Ruth Milkman, and Katie Rosenblatt.\n\n6:30\u20137:30 p.m. Break.

For years, he and his wife, Gillian, have lived beyond their means. Now their debts and bad decisions are catching up with them, and Kyung is anxious for his family\u2019s future. A few miles away, his parents, Jin and Mae, live in the town\u2019s most exclusive neighborhood, surrounded by the material comforts that Kyung desires for his wife and son. Growing up, they gave him every possible advantage\u2014private tutors, expensive hobbies\u2014but they never showed him kindness. Kyung can hardly bear to see them now, much less ask for their help. Yet when an act of violence leaves Jin and Mae unable to live on their own, the dynamic suddenly changes, and he\u2019s compelled to take them in. For the first time in years, the Chos find themselves living under the same roof. Tensions quickly mount as Kyung\u2019s proximity to his parents forces old feelings of guilt and anger to the surface, along with a terrible and persistent question: how can he ever be a good husband, father, and son when he never knew affection as a child?\n\nAs Shelter veers swiftly toward its startling conclusion, Jung Yun leads us through dark and violent territory, where, unexpectedly, the Chos discover hope. Shelter is a masterfully crafted debut novel that asks what it means to provide for one's family and, in answer, delivers a story as riveting as it is profound.\n\n\"Shelter is domestic drama at its best, a gripping narrative of secrets and revelations that seized me from beginning to end.\"\u2014Viet Thanh Nguyen, Pulitzer Prize-Winning author of The Sympathizer\n\nJung Yun was born in South Korea, grew up in North Dakota, and educated at Vassar College, the University of Pennsylvania, and University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Her work has appeared in Tin House (the \u201cEmerging Voices\u201d issue); The Best of Tin House: Stories, edited by Dorothy Allison; and The Massachusetts Review; and she is the recipient of two Artist Fellowships in fiction from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and an honorable mention for the Pushcart Prize.
