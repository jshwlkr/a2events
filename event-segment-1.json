Fascinated by the simple aesthetic, the craftsmanship, and the makers\u2019 unassuming personalities and ways of life, Holmes visited many kiln towns to photograph and interview the artists and collect ceramic wares of various shapes and techniques. She donated a significant portion of her collection to UMMA in 2013.\n\nRichly introduced in this presentation are works by ceramic artists emerging in the late 1960s and the early 1970s in the town of Mashiko, two hours north of Tokyo by train. Mashiko became an international mecca of folk ceramics after Hamada Sh\u014dji (1894\u20131978), a major figure of Japan\u2019s Folk Craft (Mingei) Movement, set up his studio there in 1930. Hamada\u2019s idea of ceramic making for a new age, which combined the aesthetic of folk ceramics and the modern concept of the studio artist, attracted many younger artists of unconventional backgrounds, including women.", "date": "2016-08-15T11:00:00-04:00", "name": "In Focus: Modern Japanese Folk Ceramics"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/494075117454653/", "description": "\u201cArt is made in the freedom of the imagination with no rules\u201d\n\n\"bobrauschenbergamerica\" is a fast paced non-traditional slice of life story revolving around relationships, explored through wacky images, poetry, jokes, dance, and more, providing a wild look at American culture. \n\nWritten by Charles L.
