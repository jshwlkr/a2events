Julia will be joined in conversation by Professor William Uricchio. This event is cosponsored by the Global Media Studies Initiative in the Department of Communication Studies and the Sheldon Cohn Fund in the Department of Screen Arts & Cultures at the University of Michigan.\n\nWhat comes to be known and seen as a global iconic event? Focusing on news coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall and on contemporary retellings of the event, Julia Sonnevend discusses how storytellers build up certain events so that people remember them for a long time. The East German border opening that we know as the \"fall of the Berlin Wall\" was in fact unintentional, confusing, and prompted in part by misleading media coverage of bureaucratic missteps. But its global message is not about luck or accident or happenstance in history. Incarnated as a global iconic event, the fall of the Berlin Wall has come to communicate the momentary power that ordinary people can have. The event's story, branded as a simple phrase, a short narrative and a recognizable visual scene, provides people from China to Israel to the United States with a powerful social myth. This myth shapes our debates about separation walls and fences, borders, and refugees, and the possibilities of human freedom to this day.\n\nJulia Sonnevend is Assistant Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Michigan. She was a Lady Davis Fellow at the Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace in Israel in 2014 and a Leibniz Fellow at the Center for Contemporary History in Germany in 2015. She is co-editor of Education and Social Media: Toward a Digital Future (forthcoming with MIT Press in 2016). She is author and co-author of articles published in journals including Journalism Studies, Columbia Journalism Review and The New Everyday. Her work also appears in edited collections including Digital Keywords: A Vocabulary of Information Society and Culture (Ed. Benjamin Peters, Princeton University Press, forthcoming in 2016), Iconic Power: Materiality and Meaning in Social Life (Eds. Jeffrey C. Alexander et al, Palgrave Macmillan, 2012) and Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing Through the Discipline (Eds. James Elkins et al, Routledge, 2012). She received her Ph.D. in Communications from Columbia University, her Master of Laws degree from Yale Law School and her Juris Doctorate and Master of Arts degrees in German Studies and Aesthetics from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest.\n\nWilliam Uricchio revisits the histories of old media when they were new; explores interactive and participatory documentary; writes about the past and future of television; thinks a lot about algorithms and archives; and researches cultural identities and the question of \"Americanization\" in the 20th and 21st centuries. He is Professor of Comparative Media Studies at MIT, Principal Investigator of the MIT Open Documentary Lab, and faculty director of the MISTI-Netherlands Program. He is also Professor of Comparative Media History at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and has held visiting professorships at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Stockholm University, the Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen (Lichtenberg-Kolleg), China University of Science and Technology, and in Denmark where he was DREAM professor.

Although communication to the outside world was limited, Florentine film director Franco Zeffirelli, who was editing his Taming of the Shrew in Rome, heard about it and rushed to his beloved city to film the days immediately after the flood. His documentary is titled Per Firenze (For Florence), and the English version is Florence: Days of Destruction; both are narrated by Richard Burton. The English version will be shown at this event. A year after the flood, Roger Hill, instructor of film-making at the Royal College of Art, London, documented the conservation and restoration efforts at the National Library, Florence, where over a million books were damaged during the flood. Shown in this film are scenes of the conservation of mud-covered, battered books as well as demonstrations of a limp- vellum and a full-leather binding, the techniques and materials used to recover thousands of books missing their bindings. Hill's film is titled: The Restoration of Books, Florence, 1968.\n\nThis program is part of the national symposium, \u201cThe Flood in Florence, 1966: A Fifty-Year Retrospective\u201d that explores the transformative effects of this disaster on the preservation field. The symposium is organized by the University of Michigan Library and the School of Information.
