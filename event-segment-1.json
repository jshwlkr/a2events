Buie, Assistant Professor/ Section Chair of Printmaking at the College for Creative Studies.\n\nART NOW: PRINTMAKING is the third annual exhibition in the Ann Arbor Art Center\u2019s Art Now Series.  Each year, on a rotating basis, the Ann Arbor Art Center presents a media-focused exhibition as part of the series. We are pleased to present this year's exhibit which features innovative work in printmaking.\n\n\u201cWe deal with printed images every day. Anything that is made in a reproducible format is a print.\u201d  - A Complete Guide to Materials & Processes by Beth Grabowski & Bill Fick\n\nThe field of printmaking is an ever-evolving medium that is deeply engaged in the act of social practice. Printmakers are artists who employ the rich history of printmaking as a basis for the works they create, and are also known to share their methods, facilitate workshops, and create environments where collaboration is welcomed. Although printmaking is considered to be a niche field of study, it is universally known through its traditional and historical processes such as Lithography, Intaglio, Relief, and Screen-printing. Printmaking has paved the way for technology and many digital advances, changing the landscape of the art world, politics and education. Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1936 essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d suggests that a series or an edition is equal to an \u201coriginal\u201d work, which holds an historical perception of uniqueness and authenticity.\n\nWhile some artists are heavily based in traditional modalities of printmaking, other artists will test the limits of what defines a \u201cprint\u201d and push beyond the conventional boundaries, thus allowing for hybrid processes to be employed and combined. The use of such advances include, digital photo-based imaging, sculpture, performance, video, installation, painting and drawing.\n\nThis exhibition will highlight artists that employ traditional printmaking processes, as well as artists who move across disciplines, using \u201cprint\u201d as their foundation, with an emphasis on investigative and exploratory ways of working with the printed image.\n\n-----------\n\nThe 117 Gallery 2016/2017 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC\n\nArt Now: Printmaking is sponsored by Underground Printing", "date": "2017-02-03T18:00:00-05:00", "name": "Art Now: Printmaking", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1857023781249128/"}]
