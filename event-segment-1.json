Johnson, and author of Ann Arbor Beer, David Bardallis, for a discussion of Detroit Beer: A History of Brewing in the Motor City. This event will take place next door in the tap room at Arbor Brewing Company, with the bar open for business! Both books will be available for purchase.\n\nWhile in recent years Detroit\u2019s craft beer scene has exploded with activity and innovation, brewing has a long history in the Motor City. Small brewers popped up during the mid-1800s to support nearby saloons. Many breweries survived the dry years by producing \u201cnear beer,\u201d or non-alcoholic beer, which was quickly abandoned after Prohibition. Consolidation marked the following decades until only Stroh Brewery Company remained. Local brewing returned triumphantly with dozens of breweries opening their doors since the 1990s, including Motor City Brewing Works, Atwater Brewery and Kuhnhenn Brewing Company. \n\nStephen Johnson is the owner and founder of Motor City Brew Tours, a tour company that provides guided tours to Michigan breweries. He is also an adjunct professor of marketing at Macomb Community College and has worked in both sales and marketing for over twenty years. Stephen earned a bachelor\u2019s in business from Western Michigan University and a master\u2019s of business administration from Walsh College of Business. A Michigan native, Stephen loves to share his knowledge and history of Detroit the beer scene.\n\nDavid Bardallis is the author of Ann Arbor Beer: A Hoppy History of Tree Town Brewing, and a former beer columnist for the Ann Arbor News an MLive.

At the forbidden nearby river, they meet a madman who persuades the oldest of the boys that he is destined to be killed by one of his siblings.

The 36th edition of NNA2 will be next Thursday, July 21! Up this month: a fantastic trio of full-spectrum talks by some of Ann Arbor's greatest. Katie Prater will take us beyond The Game of Life to introduce us to the wide world of European board games. Lorraine Suzuki will explain what's going on in your brain when you're learning to ride a bike (and why that's different than memorizing state capitals!). And Danny Mayer will show us how evolution shapes our lives by impacting culture as well as our genes. So grab a drink and a couple of pals to come beat the heat with your fellow nerds!\n\nWhen: Thursday, July 21, 2016, doors at 6:30 pm, talks at 7 pm!\nWhere: LIVE, 102 S First St, Ann Arbor\n$$$: Free because Ann Arbor District Library has got you covered!\n\n\nKatie Prater \u2014 The Death of The Die: The Rise of \"Euro\" board games in America\nDid you \"Pass Go and Collect $200\" on your way in to work today? If you grew up playing classic American board games as a child, you're likely familiar with never-ending games of Monopoly or squabbling over some uninhabitable territory of Australia in Risk. But board games aren't just for kids anymore! Adult nerds all over America are gaming, and loving it! We'll discuss the characteristics of classic American games, the differences between those and Eurogames, and why everyone who tries them agrees that Eurogames are much more fun! If you're interested in spending your nights and weekends breeding sheep, building temples, recycling garbage, and taking control of your own destiny, this talk will get you started!\n\nAbout Katie: When not in the neuroscience lab at UofM, Katie can often be found teaching new board games to friends, with her nose in a book, playing computer games with her husband, or enjoying the outdoors. She also loves attending GenCon, where she can check out the newest board games and show off her Kaylee Frye costume. She recently completed her PhD, during which she also co-founded a science communication organization called RELATE (www.learntoRELATE.org). Follow her on Twitter at @katieeprater.\n\n\nLorraine Suzuki \u2014 Motor learning and memory systems\nAs we learn motor skills we use two memory systems. These systems are separate and can compete with each other. My talk will go over some evidence of this interaction within the brain.\n\nAbout Lorraine:  Lorraine is a PhD candidate in the School of Kinesiology at the University of Michigan. She obtained a Bachelor's degree in Biology and a Master's degree in Genetics from the University of Western Brittany (Universit de Bretagne Occidentale. She now works on understanding how learning new motor skills affects brain networks.\n\n\n\nDanny Mayer \u2014  Genes, Memes, and Human Beings: Why Evolution Isn't Just a \u201cLife\u201d Thing\n\nEvolution is a part of our everyday lives. We might talk about how someone\u2019s beliefs have evolved. We might explain the success of an app or business as \u201csurvival of the fittest.\u201d But rarely do we consider that evolution\u2014in the real, scientific sense\u2014might be able to explain things other than life. Maybe life isn\u2019t as special as we think\u2014after all, viruses aren\u2019t considered by science to be alive, and yet they evolve in more or less the same way that living cells do. Enter memetics: the study of how units of cultural information (memes) evolve. Using memetics, genetics, and philosophical theories of mind and consciousness, we\u2019ll explore how evolution has shaped the world of information that we live in, how our identities are made up of both genes and memes, and how evolution plays an enduring role in the future of our species.\n\nAbout Danny:  Danny Mayer is a web designer and entrepreneur who\u2019s proud to have called Ann Arbor home for the past 6 years. After getting a degree in English from U of M, he shifted his focus to web design and programming, and now works at Magnetic, an ad tech company. His passion for design and development has given birth to several websites and even an app (coming soon), and late last year he co-founded Hyzer Shop, a Disc Golf retail shop, designing and developing the company\u2019s cutting-edge online store. Alongside all this, Danny loves keeping up with his academic interests, which include literature, philosophy, and evolutionary biology. He\u2019d like to thank his family, friends, and amazing girlfriend, all of whom inspire him to be better, and to keep learning, creating, and laughing every day.

Inspired by Bash\u014d\u2019s haibun classics such as Narrow Road to the Deep North and Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton, the book takes the reader to the mountains of Colorado, the jungles of Central America, the woods and pubs of Britain and the stunning bleakness of the badlands and prairies of the West.\n\nWilliam Hjortsberg, author of Jubilee Hitchhiker: The Life and Times of Richard Brautigan, calls the book \u201ca poet's song to the rewards of wandering and the joy of the highway\u201d; Walter Kirn, author of Up in the Air, dubs it \u201cfree-range literature\u201d and Rick Bass, author of Winter: Notes from Montana writes, \u201cThis is the kind of book parents will hide from their graduating children, but which will be found nonetheless.\u201d\n\nOriginally from Michigan, Beaudin now lives in Livingston, Montana. He is a frequent performer of his poetry and spoken word, often collaborating with jazz and rock musicians.
