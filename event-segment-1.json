Teenage Linda lives with her parents in the austere woods of northern Minnesota, where their nearly abandoned commune stands as a last vestige of a lost counter-culture world. Isolated at home and an outsider at school, Linda is drawn to the enigmatic, attractive Lily and new history teacher Mr. Grierson. When Mr. Grierson is faced with child pornography charges, his arrest deeply affects Linda as she wrestles with her own fledgling desires and craving to belong.\n\nAnd then the young Gardner family moves in across the lake and Linda finds herself welcomed into their home as a babysitter for their little boy, Paul. But with this new sense of belonging come expectations and secrets she doesn\u2019t understand. Over the course of a summer, Linda makes a set of choices that reverberate throughout her life. As she struggles to find a way out of the sequestered world into which she was born, Linda confronts the life-and-death consequences of the things people do\u2014and fail to do\u2014for the people they love.\n\nWinner of the McGinnis-Ritchie award for its first chapter, and A BEA Buzz Book and An ABA Indies Introduce Selection, Emily Fridlund\u2019s agonizing and gorgeously written History of Wolves introduces a new writer of enormous range and talent.\n\n\u201c\u2018Winter collapsed on us that year. It knelt down, exhausted, and stayed.\u2019 So much is accomplished here, not least a kind of trust that this writer will make everything count, including the kind of data that is usually left for dead in a story. What is literary authority, after all, but the ability to regularly, without apparent effort, make the most of every sentence, build feeling in every line and do it in such a way that is tough, tight, funny, and often brilliantly disruptive?\u201d\u2014Ben Marcus\n\n\u201cSo delicately calibrated and precisely beautiful that one might not immediately sense the sledgehammer of pain building inside this book. And I mean that in the best way. What powerful tension and depth this provides! I\u2019m so excited for readers to encounter the talent and roiling intelligence of Emily Fridlund.\u201d\u2014Aimee Bender\n\n\"As exquisite a first novel as I\u2019ve ever encountered. Poetic, complex, and utterly, heartbreakingly beautiful.\" \u2014T. C. Boyle\n\nEmily Fridlund grew up in Minnesota and currently resides in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Her fiction has appeared in a wide variety of journals. She holds a PhD in Literature and Creative Writing from the University of Southern California and currently teaches at Cornell University. Fridlund's collection of stories, Catapult, was a finalist for the Noemi Book Award for Fiction and the Tartts First Fiction Award. It won the Mary McCarthy Prize and will be published by Sarabande in 2017. The opening chapter of History of Wolves was published in Southwest Review and won the 2013 McGinnis-Ritchie Award for Fiction.", "date": "2017-02-17T19:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/472588303129144/", "name": "Emily Fridlund"}, {"description": "Aaaaaand we're back!
