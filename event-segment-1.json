Often, the cinematic image stands in for real life as it plays out behind windows in the buildings, sometimes creating a sense of mystery, other times stressing the mundane. Snelling\u2019s work derives from voyeurism, film noir, and geographical and architectural location. Within this idea of location, themes develop that transport observation into the realm of storytelling, with reality and sociological study being the focus. Snelling had exhibited in international galleries, museums and institutions, including the The Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Belgium; Palazzo Reale, Milan; Museum of Arts and Design, New York; Kunstmuseen Krefeld Germany; El Museo de Arte de Banco de la Republica, Bogota; the Stenersen Museet, Oslo, and the Sundance Film Festival. Her short films have screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, Circuito Off in Venice, Italy, and the Arquiteturas Film Festival Lisboa in Portugal. She also received a 2015 Joan Mitchell Painters and Sculptors Grant. Snelling lives and works in Oakland, California and Berlin, Germany.\n\nA Penny Stamps Speaker Series presentation in partnership with the Institute for the Humanities and co-sponsored by the University of Michigan Museum of Art.", "date": "2017-03-20T17:10:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1637065343255870/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"name": "Sunseed Farm CSA Pickup", "description": "Join us every Tuesday for beer and veggies!

Brought in to construct the towering monuments to wealth that punctuate the skylines of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, this labor force works without the rights of citizenship, endures miserable living conditions, and is ultimately forced to leave the country. Until now, the humanitarian crisis of the so-called \u201cguest workers\u201d of the Gulf has barely been addressed in fiction. With his stunning, mind-altering debut novel Temporary People, Deepak Unnikrishnan delves into their histories, myths, struggles, and triumphs. \n\nCombining the irrepressible linguistic invention of Salman Rushdie and the satirical vision of George Saunders, Unnikrishnan presents twenty-eight linked stories that careen from construction workers who shapeshift into luggage and escape a labor camp, to a woman who stitches back together the bodies of those who\u2019ve fallen from buildings in progress, to a man who grows ideal workers designed to live twelve years and then perish\u2014until they don\u2019t, and found a rebel community in the desert. With this polyphony, Unnikrishnan brilliantly maps a new, unruly global English. Giving substance and identity to the anonymous workers of the Gulf, he highlights the disturbing ways in which \u201cprogress\u201d on a global scale is bound up with dehumanization. \n\nDeepak Unnikrishnan is a writer from Abu Dhabi, and an editor at The State. His fiction and essays have appeared in Guernica, Drunken Boat, Himal Southasian, Bound Off, The State Vol IV: Dubai and in the anthology The Apex Book of World SF 4, among others.\n\n \n\nEvent date: \nMonday, March 20, 2017 - 7:00pm\n\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II.\nFor this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body\u2019s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist. Her grandfather\u2019s role in the history of the site underscores Ruben\u2019s personal connection.\nThe exhibition presents Ruben\u2019s photographs of Willow Run in UMMA\u2019s Photography Gallery and an original film\u2014co-created by Ruben and video artist Seth Bernstein and featuring an original score by award-winning composer Stephen Hartke\u2014in the Museum\u2019s Forum.\n\nLead support for Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Herbert W. and Susan L.
