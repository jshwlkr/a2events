Allowing the rich textures, brilliant colors and nuanced lines of stitched textiles to interact with the mysterious beauty of the imprinted stone, a gentle branch or a fragile leaf, students will create a framed (20\u201d x 20\u201d) stitched, three-dimensional textile assemblage. Instruction will be given for the steps used to create a fiber work composition, the techniques used to incorporate natural materials, and for finishing, mounting and framing the finished art work.

Joseph will be joined by UM professor Claire Vaye Watkins, author of Battleborn and Gold Fame Citrus.\n\nReinventing a great American tradition through an absurdist, discerning eye, Joseph Scapellato uses these twenty-five stories to conjure worlds, themes, and characters who are at once unquestionably familiar and undeniably strange. Big Lonesome navigates through the American West\u2014from the Old West to the modern-day West to the Midwest, from cowboys to mythical creatures to everything in between\u2014exploring place, myth, masculinity, and what it means to be whole or to be broken. Though he works in the tradition of George Saunders and Patrick deWitt\u2014writing subversive, surreal, and affecting stories that unveil the surprising inner lives of ordinary people and the mythic dimensions of our everyday lives\u2014\"Scapellato\u2019s Big Lonesome is unlike anything else you\u2019ve ever read\" (Robert Boswell).\n\nJoseph Scapellato is a visiting assistant professor of English at Bucknell University. His fiction has appeared in Kenyon Review Online, Gulf Coast, Post Road, Puerto Del Sol, PANK, and Lumina, as well as other journals, and has been anthologized in Harper Perennial's Forty Stories, Gigantic Books' Gigantic Worlds: An Anthology of Science Flash Fiction and &NOW's forthcoming The Best Innovative Writing anthology.\n\nEvent date: \nFriday, March 10, 2017 - 7:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/223665541433367/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Joseph Scapellato, w/ Claire Vaye Watkins"}, {"date": "2017-03-10T19:30:00-05:00", "description": "VIDEO PREVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4PpvXNZK3I\n\nMORE INFO: http://ums.org/performance/the-beauty-queen-of-leenane/\n\nAs tragically funny as it is horrific, this brilliantly subversive play takes place in an economically depressed Irish village in the early 1990s, with a vicious and relentless war of wills between a manipulative, aging mother, Mag, and her plain and lonely 40-year-old daughter, Maureen. After years of caring for her ungrateful mother, Maureen has little hope of happiness or escape, especially after Mag ruins her first, and perhaps only, chance of a loving relationship. This is confrontational theater at its most potent, with characters locked in mortal combat and mutual loathing.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/614995318650187/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "The Beauty Queen of Leenane: Druid"}, {"date": "2017-03-10T19:30:00-05:00", "description": "Join us for a rousing evening of Kander & Ebb's best songs, in new, inventive arrangements and mashups, at Conor O'Neill's Irish Pub in Ann Arbor!
