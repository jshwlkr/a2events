The band\u2019s music \u2014 a genre-bending hybrid of indie-pop melodies, global rhythms and songwriting styles influenced from all over the world \u2014 was as broad as their audience, which stretched from the group\u2019s hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to the shores of Osaka, Japan (where they scored a Number One pop hot with the song \u201cBook of Matches\u201d). Show by show, in venues ranging from rock clubs and performing arts centers to festivals encompassing everything from bluegrass to electronica, The Ragbirds developed a well-deserved reputation as one of the most dynamic, high-spirited live bands in roots music.\nThe Ragbirds albums have received local and national praise, hailed \u201cHighly impressive!\u201d by USA Today and touted as \u201cAstounding international eclecticism\u201d by Reveal Arts.  The band has performed in over forty-five states to a tune of 150+ shows a year, The Ragbirds have become festival favorites.  They have won over crowds at  Electric Forest, 10,000 Lakes, CMJ Music Marathon, Summer Camp, Wheatland, Blissfest, Wookiefoot\u2019s Harvest Fest,  Ann Arbor Folk Festival, Hookahville, to name a few; and have shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Rusted Root, Matisyahu, Railroad Earth, John Butler Trio,  Toubab Krewe,  Cornmeal, Greensky Bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum,  Jeff Daniels, The Everyone Orchestra, The Duhks, and many others.For all their traveling, The Ragbirds maintain a steady connection to their home base.  While reflecting on Michigan, Erin had this to say \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a beautiful place to be, snuggled in the Great Lakes, close enough to hold hands with Canada. It is connected to a secret, mysterious, magical place called the U.P., but most of all there is an amazingly talented and humbly supportive music community that spreads through the state, clustered into groups in Ann Arbor and Lansing, Grand Rapids, Flint, Traverse City and Detroit. The scene (and scenery) keeps us fueled with love and inspiration.\u201d\n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

What we believe may or may not be true, but unknowingly most of us will behave in ways that reinforce our beliefs anyways. At this breakfast, Ari Weinzweig, Co-Founder and CEO of Zingerman\u2019s Community of Businesses, will take a look at how the impact of those beliefs likely play out in our day to day experiences in the workplace, and how we and our workplaces are impacted by those beliefs. Whether we accept it or not, what we believe about ourselves, about our organization, our co-workers, our boss, the work that we do and our ability to do it will significantly alter the outcomes we are seeking to achieve. And how, by becoming more mindful of our beliefs, we can effectively backtrack\u2014by altering our beliefs, we change the way we see our work and the world and then, in turn, significantly alter the outcomes we get from our efforts.\n\nIt is our belief you will leave breakfast with a full stomach and a full mind - with new insights, tips and techniques into how you can become more mindful of your own beliefs and how you can positively affect your surroundings by changing your beliefs.\n\nBreakfast is served!\n- Fresh Fruit Platter\n- Zingerman\u2019s Bakehouse Coffee Cakes\n- Corned Beef Hash\n- Applewood Smoked Bacon\n- Zingerman\u2019s Coffee Co.
