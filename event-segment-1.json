Fascinated by the simple aesthetic, the craftsmanship, and the makers\u2019 unassuming personalities and ways of life, Holmes visited many kiln towns to photograph and interview the artists and collect ceramic wares of various shapes and techniques. She donated a significant portion of her collection to UMMA in 2013.\n\nRichly introduced in this presentation are works by ceramic artists emerging in the late 1960s and the early 1970s in the town of Mashiko, two hours north of Tokyo by train. Mashiko became an international mecca of folk ceramics after Hamada Sh\u014dji (1894\u20131978), a major figure of Japan\u2019s Folk Craft (Mingei) Movement, set up his studio there in 1930. Hamada\u2019s idea of ceramic making for a new age, which combined the aesthetic of folk ceramics and the modern concept of the studio artist, attracted many younger artists of unconventional backgrounds, including women.", "name": "In Focus: Modern Japanese Folk Ceramics"}, {"date": "2016-08-15T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/494075117454653/", "description": "\u201cArt is made in the freedom of the imagination with no rules\u201d\n\n\"bobrauschenbergamerica\" is a fast paced non-traditional slice of life story revolving around relationships, explored through wacky images, poetry, jokes, dance, and more, providing a wild look at American culture. \n\nWritten by Charles L.

With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, its no wonder why they are headlining festivals and one of Michigan\u2019s top rising stars.  Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, and\u2014at last\u2014into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.   Their new album \u201cTerra Incognita \u201c goes beyond their comfort limits into new styles, new instruments, and new vocals. Everything works out in favor of Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers. It might be early to say, but Terra Incognita could be just what they need to push them over the threshold. Fans that love Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers for their folk melodies will not be disappointed. Though they\u2019ve gone in new directions, the new album still features songs similar to those on On Being. With slow, precise fingerpicking Joe gently sings poetry similar to their old stuff in \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d and \u201cRed Wings.\u201d\nhttp://www.joehertler.com \n\n2016 Lineup \n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor. Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts.

Beloved heckler Kevin Davis is back to talk data storage and perhaps ruin any illusions you may have regarding the cloud. And fellow NNA2 alum Carl Engelke (of the amazing homemade trumpet!) brings us home with his talk on the most epic magical saga of all time - Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle. Going to be a great night, so grab some friends and a couple of cold ones to join us at Nerd Nite!\n\nWhen: Thursday, August 18, 2016, doors at 6:30 pm, talks at 7 pm!\nWhere: LIVE, 102 S First St, Ann Arbor\n$$$: Free , thanks AADL!\n\nAric J Schultz: \"OMG, GMOs.\"\nWe often hear the term \"genetically modified organisms\" (GMOs) without much context as to what they are and what they are not. I\u2019ll explain how they are made, plus their application and impact.\n\nAbout Aric: \nI am a graduate student in the microbiology department at the University of Michigan Medical School. I study a microscopic parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, in order to learn more about how it causes disease in humans and identify aspects of this infection that could be exploited and used in the treatment of the disease. Outside of the lab I enjoy practicing brazilian jiu jitsu, gardening, and of course science communication. Follow him on Twitter at @aricj10.\n\nCarl Engelke: \"The use of leitmotif in Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle: A boring musicology talk\"\nThe original \u201cnever-ending story,\u201d (okay, so it\u2019s actually 15 hours) Wagner\u2019s epic opera cycle Der Ring des Niebelungen is widely regarded as the best way to thoroughly convince people that they hate opera. But it need not be so! As we cruise through a \u201cbrief\u201d synopsis of the plot, we will explore how Wagner\u2019s use of musical motifs neatly ties the storyline together, and how this compositional style has influenced the development of film scores.\n\nAbout Carl: \nCarl had many, varied interests throughout the years, and he still sometimes wonders what he wants to do when (if) he grows up. He studied trumpet performance in college at Indiana University and the Royal Academy of Music in London, and performed with the Civic Orchestra of Chicago upon graduation. Currently, as a completely logical next step, he is an MD/PhD student at the University of Michigan Medical School, where he studies how chromatin dynamics influence the development and progression of prostate cancer.\n\nKevin Davis: \"Flipping Bits: The History of Data Storage\"\nA review of the advancement of data storage and archival technologies, from the Mainframe to the Pokedex.\n\nAbout Kevin: \nA SAN Engineer for a Fortune 10 company, Kevin determines the best IT storage solutions, for needs ranging from PowerPoint to Oracle. A 17-year IT veteran, he spends his days hard drive drag racing, writing manuals and procedure guides, reviewing new builds, and overseeing storage operations.", "name": "NNA2 #37: Go Big!
