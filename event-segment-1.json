Seating is first-come, first-served.\nPresented by: Swarupa Anila, Director of Interpretive Engagement, Detroit Institute of Arts\n\nAs museums strive to serve broad, ever-diversifying publics, it is no longer possible to deny the ways museums mirror and reinforce racial, cultural, and class inequities of the broader society. Skillful racial and cultural representation in interpretation and programming is not only an intellectual exercise; it is an ethical responsibility that requires fracturing the known through consistent individual and institutional self-reflection and action. This talk focuses on the challenging and often painful internal work toward developing diversity and strategies and actions supporting systemic change in museum representation, interpretation, and ideation.\n\nSwarupa Anila is director of interpretive engagement at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Key issues she pursues in interpretive planning practice include examining whose voices and perspectives are missing in museum interpretation, how to integrate visitor voices to flatten museum and art historical knowledge hierarchies, and how to design museum interpretation that supports dynamic, meaningful visitor engagements with art.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Museum Studies website.\nCo-sponsored by the U-M Museum of Art", "name": "U-M Museum Studies Program Presents: \"Inclusion Requires Fractur", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1778744065683778/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-06T19:00:00-05:00", "description": "In his Wine Report 2005, British wine writer Tom Stevenson honored Larry Mawby with the title \u201cfizzmaster exraordinaire\u201d.
