Performances are Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday-Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Ticket prices are $22 for adults, $20 for seniors, $17 for tickets on Thursday, with student tickets just $11 for any performance.

Additional information is available by visiting www.a2ct.org.  \nThe archetypal villain, Iago, plots against his commander, the moor, Othello, using Othello\u2019s beautiful (and secret) wife, Desdemona, as the linchpin in his scheme. Shakespeare\u2019s tale of jealousy, revenge, and betrayal asks the question, what happens to the boundaries of good and evil as men and women are pushed to desperation in the midst of war?\nA2CT\u2019s upcoming production sets this tale of treachery and revenge against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, with its newly integrated armed services. Says director David Widmayer, \u201c[This setting] has helped me bring this show to life in a way I'm not sure I otherwise could. It's helpful both for the actors and for the audience to understand the context surrounding the play, and that's a very tall order when we're talking about an early seventeenth century English translation of a sixteenth century Italian story.\u201d He approaches the well-known classic with an eye toward the parallels to today, and the larger questions of nature versus nurture. \u201cIago and Othello don't do terrible things because they're terrible people, but because they've been deeply immersed in a culture which expects men to resort to violence first to solve their problems. The fact that we're still grappling with these issues as a culture centuries after Othello was written is staggering.\u201d\nThe talented cast is led by Justin Gordon as Othello, Ann Dilworth as Desdemona, Sean Sabo as Iago, and Carol Gray as Emilia.

In an era defined by mass incarceration, endless war, economic crisis, catastrophic environmental destruction, and a political system offering more of the same, radical social transformation has never been more urgent. Demand the Impossible! urges us to imagine a world beyond what this rotten system would have us believe is possible. In critiquing the world around us, insurgent educator and activist Bill Ayers uncovers cracks in the system, raising our sights for radical change, and envisioning strategies for building a movement to create a more humane, balanced, and peaceful world.\n\n\"For Bill Ayers, it is the freedom of our collective imagination that links the contemporary world\u2014ensconced as it is in pervasive militarism, racist violence, and environmental devastation\u2014to the flourishing of our planet. This is a manifesto that should be read by everyone who wants to believe that \u201canother world is possible.\u201d\u2014Angela Y. Davis, author of Abolition Democracy and Freedom is a Constant Struggle\n\n\"With huge numbers of us recognizing the need for transformative change, this ambitious and exuberant book perfectly matches its historical moment. Ayers fearlessly confronts the intersecting crises of our age\u2014endless war, surging inequality, unchecked white supremacy and perilous planetary warming\u2014while mapping emancipatory new possibilities. From the first page, his courage is contagious.\"\u2014Naomi Klein, author of This Changes Everything and The Shock Doctrine\n\n\"Demand the Impossible is more than a book, more than a manifesto. It is a torch. Bill Ayers\u2019 vision for a humane future is incendiary\u2014fire that incinerates old logics and illuminates new paths. If we do not end the violence of militarism, materialism, caging, dispossession, debt, want, ignorance, and global warming, our very survival is impossible. Read aloud.\"\u2014Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams\n\nBill Ayers is a social justice activist, teacher, Distinguished Professor of Education (retired) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of two memoirs, Fugitive Days and Public Enemy.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, October 31, 2016 - 7:00pm", "date": "2016-10-31T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1085363878179621/", "name": "Bill Ayers"}]
