Performances are Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. All tickets are $12, with a $2 discount at the Sunday performance for those bringing a photo\u2014printed or on a cell phone\u2014of them with their dog, or a non-perishable pet supply donation. In collaboration with the Humane Society of Huron Valley, donations of pet supplies and food, as well as monetary donations, will be accepted at every performance. Tickets are available by calling the office at 734-971-2228, or at the door.  Additional information is available by visiting www.a2ct.org.  \nSylvia finds Greg and Kate, recent empty-nesters, at a cross roads in their relationship. Kate is a middle school English teacher who fills the void with a renewed commitment to her career. Greg, on the other hand, flounders in a job he has grown to dislike and a surplus of free time. Enter Sylvia, a disarming dog of unknown origins whom Greg finds unattended in Central Park. Greg brings Sylvia home, much to Kate\u2019s displeasure. As the bond between Greg and Sylvia grows, a chasm opens in Greg and Kate\u2019s marriage into which friends, a well-meaning fellow dog owner, and a misguided therapist fall. With sharp wit and biting satire, A.R. Gurney explores the age-old connection between man and his best friend.\n\u201cI saw a scene from Sylvia in an acting showcase a few years ago and fell in love with the play,\u201d says director Cassie Mann. \u201cHaving a young woman play a dog\u2014not in a dog suit but as a fully-conversant human with dog tendencies--is a brilliant device. The audience gets to experience the inner life of a dog as well as the relationships between Sylvia and those around her. The comedy builds as the relationship between Sylvia and Greg grows, but there\u2019s also a poignant message about how a longtime couple navigates their post-child-rearing years.\u201d\n\nThe cast of Sylvia features Stacy Buck as Sylvia, Larry Rusinsky as Greg, and Denyse Clayton as Kate. The cast also includes Lonnie Curri, Dave Giles, and Celeste Green. \n\nSylvia contains adult themes and languages and is intended for mature audiences. ***", "date": "2016-09-30T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Sylvia"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/508962365964547/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Ann Arbor singer, songwriter and recording artist Khalid Hanifi brings his fine band, featuring drummer Chuck Mauk, guitarist Alex Anest, bassist Don Beyer and keyboardist Grace Mauk to Kerrytown Concert House for an evening of vibrant, lyrically incisive and irrepressibly tuneful original songs.", "date": "2016-09-30T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Khalid Hanifi at Kerrytown Concert House"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/517141991807074/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Jeremy Horn grew up in Memphis -- \"Home of the Blues\" and \"Birthplace of Rock and Roll\" -- but his music sounds more like the Beatles than B.B. King or Elvis.  He writes songs for the church and songs for the radio, yet his songs are more complex than either has traditionally allowed.  He lives in a city that is known as much for its racial unrest and inner-city violence as it is for being the place Elvis called home, yet he leads worship at one of the largest multicultural churches in the South, where half the congregation is African-American. When you meet Jeremy, he looks and sounds just like the \"guy next door\" -- if the guy next door has a traditional southern drawl.  Making music has preoccupied  Jeremy Horn ever since he received his first guitar at age fifteen. Growing up on the sounds of James Taylor and the Beatles, Jeremy spent most of his early years emulating the sounds and songwriting styles of the popular culture. \"I used to write songs about social injustices in the world,\" says Horn. After a few years and conversations with a wise, older friend, Jeremy realized he could also write songs that aspired to give people hope, and not just write what everybody else was writing. Says Horn, \"That progressed into writing songs for Jesus, and that was the process that unexpectedly led me to become a worship leader.\" That progression started Jeremy Horn on the path of continued discovery --listening to artists both Christian and not -- to figure out how to express feelings and concepts that came from within, rather than from the evening news.  Jeremy's music is a fixture on Michigan's 17 Smile-FM Contemporary Christian music stations; his \"I Will See Angels 'Round Your Throne\" and \"First Love\" are two of his popular hits. Jeremy's new CD is No Other Love. This is a rare opportunity to see Jeremy Horn in a small venue setting.
