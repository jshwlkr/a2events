In Know the Mother, author Desiree Cooper explores the complex archetype of the mother in all of her incarnations. In a collage of meditative stories, women\u2014both black and white\u2014find themselves wedged between their own yearnings and their roles as daughters, sisters, grandmothers, and wives.\n\nIn this heart-wrenching collection, Cooper reveals that gender and race are often unanticipated interlopers in family life. An anxious mother reflects on her prenatal fantasies of suicide while waiting for her daughter to come home late one night. A lawyer miscarries during a conference call and must proceed as though nothing has happened. On a rare night out with her husband, a new mother tries convincing herself that everything is still the same. A politician\u2019s wife\u2019s thoughts turn to slavery as she contemplates her own escape: \"Even Harriet Tubman had realized that freedom wasn\u2019t worth the price of abandoning her family, so she\u2019d come back home. She\u2019d risked it all for love.\" With her lyrical and carefully crafted prose, Cooper\u2019s stories provide truths without sermon and invite empathy without sentimentality.\n\nKnow the Mother explores the intersection of race and gender in vignettes that pull you in and then are gone in an instant. Readers of short fiction will appreciate this deeply felt collection.\n\nA 2015 Kresge Artist Fellow, Desiree Cooper is a former attorney, Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist and Detroit community activist whose fiction dives unflinchingly into the intersection of racism and sexism. Using the compressed medium of flash fiction, she explores intimate spaces to reveal what it means to be human. Her fiction and poetry have appeared in Callaloo, Detroit Noir, Best African American Fiction 2010, and Tidal Basin Review, among other online and print publications. Cooper was a founding board member of Cave Canem, a national residency for emerging black poets. She is currently a Kimbilio fellow, a national residency for African American fiction writers.", "date": "2016-04-04T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Desiree Cooper"}]
