Live Guitar and Vocals. Based in Michigan.\n\n+++ Tek - Mazter ++++\nTek-Mazter is in the game for the love of the music and the process of creating it for other people's ears to enjoy. He never sticks to performing or creating just one genre, his mixes and tracks consist of anything from the heaviest Riddim Dubstep to Chill Trap. In his short career he has performed alongside DJ Starscream (Slipknot's DJ), has been local support for Ghastly, Truth, Eptic, YOOKiE, AB The Thief and Toadface, opened for Timeflies & Walk Off The Earth, DJ'd for D12's Bizarre and has played some legendary venues such as The Detroit Masonic Temple, St. Andrews Hall, Necto Nightclub, Elektricity Nightclub and The Works Nightclub.\n\n+++ KNGHT +++\nMy name is Brendan Knight \nI perform and produce Experimental Bass music\nMichigan is my home and I love what I do!\n\n+++ KAZRK +++\nThis Bass Duo has residencies at some of the hottest dance bars and nightclubs throughout the state of Michigan, and have had massive opening sets for headliners such as Nghtmre, Slander, Funtcase, Liquid Stranger, Skism, Trampa, Ghastly, and many more. Now before you think they're just a one-genere style Duo, think again. KAZRK has a broad spectrum for music ranging from all ends of electronic dance music, hip-hop, and rap genres. Farthest from the common mixing styles, no two sets are ever the same. With mixing abilities take you on a journey throughout each genre telling a story unlike any other. As each set progresses, you'll find yourself at the other end of the musical spectrum.\n\n+++ DJ Lachjaw +++\nDJ Lachjaw - A local Detroit DJ that brings the heat to the stage is going on his 5th year mixing music starting out back in 2012. He has built his reputation by standing out and perfecting his craft. If you've seen him perform you know it's far from a mellow disappointment so be ready for a dish of a full force brutal double dropping bass chopping experience. Over the years he has supported many artists opening the stage for Funtcase, Sewer Sessions, Subtronics, Boogie T and many more. \n\n+++  Brightside +++\nFor the 25 year old Queens native producer, Brightside, it's not just about the music, it's about the movement. His vision is to produce auditory art that brings people together and creates a sense of community. Brightside has a predominantly mid-tempo sound, drawing inspiration from all ends of the spectrum. In a conscious effort to reach all audiences, Brightside samples a widely eclectic library of music from all around the world, creating psychedelic sounds with Middle Eastern, Asian, Classic Rock, Hip-Hop and even Reggae flare.\n\n\n+++  Blaqout +++\nWhether you've seen him live, or heard of the barrage of releases that have been coming out, Lance \"Blaqout\" Dean has a firm grip on what he's doing and is not looking to stop anytime soon. This young producer heiling from St. Louis, Missouri has proven what others have told him to be impossible, or improbable. At a mere 16 years of age, UK-based record label Relentik Records signed him to his first deal and it's snowballed from there, to say the least. Shortly afterwards, his hometown radio station caught wind of his perserverence and passion and began playing some of his tracks,\nshortly after an insightful interview took place, which really showed just how much this artist lives, and breathes music.\n\n-----------VENDORS------------\nPhiber Printing\nMI kulture\n\n-----------Live Art---------------\nTBA!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/143362169483025/", "date": "2017-01-14T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Pointless Improv with Drama Club and Human Amusements", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers. \n\nGroup 1: Drama Club \nGroup 2: Human Amusements\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1230992306980244/", "date": "2017-01-14T22:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Family Art Studio: Making African Masks", "description": "Family Art studio sessions run 11am-1pm and 2\u20134 pm.\nRegistration is required: email umma-program-registration@umich.edu.
