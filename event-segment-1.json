Nenadic & M. Joanne Nesbit for an evening of discussion about Ann Arbor Icons and Legends.\n\nWhat is an iconic Ann Arbor restaurant? Ask anyone who has ever spent time there as a student, traveler, or townie, and they are likely to name several favorites in an instant. From debating the best place to celebrate or console on football Saturdays to deciding where to eat after the bars close, the choices have always sparked passionate conversation. In Ann Arbor, people are known to have strong feelings about the best places for pizza, coffee, beer, burgers, noodles, and burritos. Although many of the go-to hangouts are long gone, a surprising number still thrive. And there are always a few newcomers coming along to win the hearts of the next generation of diners, nibblers, and noshers. Some are fine restaurants and taverns, and others are lunch counters, diners, carry-outs, and drive-ins but in each and every case, they are unique and together make up a collection of iconic local eateries.\n\nGraced by the Huron River with an abundance of parks, Ann Arbor offers residents and visitors entertainment, sports, shopping, dining, and of course, the University of Michigan. Legendary Locals of Ann Arbor celebrates its citizens. Some of those who make up Ann Arbor are creative artists, inspiring educators, dedicated public servants, and determined business owners. With the exception of Lewis the cat, who reigned at Downtown Home and Garden, this book is filled with stories about people who have made and are making Ann Arbor one of the best places to live in the United States. Within its pages lie the stories of who chose maize and blue as the University of Michigan s colors; who was the first Ann Arborite to race in the Indy 500; and who sold Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino s, his first pizzeria. Inside are photographs and descriptions of the legendary people of the past and the present, as well as those who are on their way to becoming the legends of the future.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/660281374136185/", "name": "Ann Arbor Icons & Legends"}, {"date": "2016-11-29T08:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

Scott Savitt, one of the first American exchange students in Beijing, picks up his guitar and begins strumming \u201cBlackbird.\u201d He\u2019s soon surrounded by Chinese students who know every word to every Beatles song he plays. Scott stays on in Beijing, working as a reporter for Asiaweek Magazine. The city\u2019s first nightclubs open; rock \u2018n\u2019 roll promises democracy. Promoted to foreign correspondent for the Los Angeles Times then United Press International, Scott finds himself drawn into China\u2019s political heart. His girlfriend is the assistant to Bette Bao Lord, the wife of the U.S. ambassador. He interviews people who will become leaders of the democracy movement.\n\nLater, at 25 years old, Scott is the youngest accredited foreign correspondent in China, with an intimate knowledge of Beijing\u2019s backstreets. But as the seven-week occupation of Tiananmen Square ends in bloodshed on June 4, 1989, his greatest asset is his flame-red 500cc Honda motorcycle \u2014 giving Scott the freedom to witness first-hand what the Chinese government still denies ever took place. After Tiananmen, Scott founds the first independent English language newspaper in China, Beijing Scene. He knows that it\u2019s only a matter of time before the authorities move in, and sure enough, in 2000 he\u2019s arrested, flung into solitary confinement and, after a month in jail, deported.\n\nScott Savitt is the in-house Chinese-English translator for numerous human rights organizations and the New York Times.
