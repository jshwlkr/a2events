Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II.\nFor this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body\u2019s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist. Her grandfather\u2019s role in the history of the site underscores Ruben\u2019s personal connection.\nThe exhibition presents Ruben\u2019s photographs of Willow Run in UMMA\u2019s Photography Gallery and an original film\u2014co-created by Ruben and video artist Seth Bernstein and featuring an original score by award-winning composer Stephen Hartke\u2014in the Museum\u2019s Forum.\n\nLead support for Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Herbert W. and Susan L.

After years of caring for her ungrateful mother, Maureen has little hope of happiness or escape, especially after Mag ruins her first, and perhaps only, chance of a loving relationship. This is confrontational theater at its most potent, with characters locked in mortal combat and mutual loathing.", "date": "2017-03-12T20:30:00-04:00", "name": "The Beauty Queen of Leenane: Druid"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1877727032438874/", "description": "Ann Arbor Civic Theatre presents Almost, Maine by John Cariani, directed by Kat Walsh, March 9-12, 2017, at the University of Michigan\u2019s Arthur Miller Theatre, 1226 Murfin Ave, 48109.

Additional information is available by visiting www.a2ct.org. \n \nAlmost, Maine is a town so far north, it\u2019s almost in Canada, almost not in the United States, it\u2019s just \u2026 Almost. On a cold, clear night in this remotest of towns, witness nine stories of residents falling in and out of love in the strangest of ways. Set against the hovering northern lights, hearts get broken, knees get bruised, and love is lost, found, and confounded. It\u2019s love. But not quite.\n \nThe subject of this critically acclaimed play is something that veteran director Kat Walsh sees as universal to audiences, and her direction aims to make that connection. \u201cMeaningful relationships require vulnerability --- it means allowing yourself to be fully seen and heard by another person and risking rejection. John Cariani brilliantly captures these inspiring, and yes frightening, moments in his play, Almost, Maine,\" shared director Walsh. \"Our actors and production staff have the heroic task of portraying these acts of courage on stage for an audience. We want to tell these stories simply and honestly.\u201d\n \nThe talented cast of Almost, Maine includes Andrew Benson, Elizabeth Docel, Matthew Flickinger, Chris Grimm, Lawrence Havelka, Chris Joseph, Rachael Kohl, Stephanie Laurinec, Joe Lopez, Matthew Miller, Scott Mooney, Sara Rose, Codi Sharp, Megan Shiplett, and Michelle Weiss.", "date": "2017-03-12T20:30:00-04:00", "name": "Almost, Maine"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1006014226188234/", "description": "Can't make it to Ann Arbor on March 26?
