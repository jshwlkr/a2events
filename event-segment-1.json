Chris will be joined in conversation by Brit Bennett, author of The Mothers (coming from Riverhead in October).\n\nA vivid and assured work of fiction from a major new voice, following the life of a young man growing up, leaving home, and coming back again, marked by the stark beauty of California's Mojave Desert and the various fates of those who leave and those who stay behind. This series of powerful, intertwining stories illuminates Daley Kushner's world--the family, friends and community that have both formed and constrained him, and his new lief in San Francisco. Back home, the desert preys on those who cannot conform: an alfalfa farmer on the outskirts of town; two young girls whose curiosity leads to danger; a black politician who once served as his school's confederate mascot; Daley's mother, an immigrant from Armenia; and Daley himself, introspective and queer. Meanwhile, in another desert on the other side of the world, war threatens to fracture Daley's most meaningful--and most fraught--connection to home, his friendship with Robert Karinger. A luminous debut, Desert Boys traces the development of towns into cities, of boys into men, and the haunting effects produced when the two transformations overlap. Both a bildungsroman and a portrait of a changing place, the book mines the terrain between the desire to escape and the hunger to belong.\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is hilarious, devious, original, and unforgettable; Chris McCormick writes with a joyful swerve and swagger that is all his own.\u201d\u2015Karen Russell, New York Times bestselling author of Vampires in the Lemon Grove\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is a show off's debut, the work of an unabashed polyglot. There seems to be nothing Chris McCormick can't do: smartypants metafictional experiment, heart-pounding thriller, eulogy for boyhood bonds, meditation on sexuality and post-9/11 intolerance. These linked stories assemble into a kind of compound eye through which we glimpse an oft-forgotten corner of California and, most superbly, a fresh take on masculine Americana. McCormick is the artsy outsider, the affectionate anthropologist, the near-feral boy with a wide-angle lens of history.\u201d\u2015Claire Vaye Watkins, author of Battleborn and Gold Fame Citrus\n\n\"In the hands of this young master of purified prose, ambition, love, and the restlessness of boyhood are trapped as if in a crystal vial. No reader will be able to turn away.\"\u2015Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen\n\n\u201cChris McCormick\u2019s book is a gift from the new West. In the dry, highland exurbs of Los Angeles and other exotic places, McCormick crafts lustrous tales of brotherhood, immigrants, love, and paintball. Filled with unforgettable characters, Desert Boys is a deeply moving journey through the natural and emotional landscapes of the American present.\u201d\u2015H\u00e9ctor Tobar, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Down Dark and The Barbarian Nurseries\n\n\u201cThis is a book about place, or really like so many books about place (Dubliners, Winesburg, Ohio) two places, in this case two Californias\u2015San Francisco on the one hand; the less familiar but finely evoked small desert community from which the narrator originates on the other. But it's also a book about shame, two shames, the shame of where we come from, and the shame of leaving it. Through a series of quietly intimate confessions we learn how torn the teller is between past and present, small town and big city, and McCormick captures this tension beautifully in the contrast between his laconic, but frankly feeling prose and his restless formal innovation. Wise and vulnerable by turns, this is a quietly stunning debut.\u201d\u2015Peter Ho Davies, author of The Welsh Girl\n\nChris McCormick was raised in the Antelope Valley. He earned his B.A. at the University of California, Berkeley, and his M.F.A. at the University of Michigan, where he was the recipient of two Hopwood Awards. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, May 4, 2016 - 7:00pm", "name": "Fiction at Literati: Chris McCormick", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1015114025230041/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-04T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Join us to celebrate Ann Arbor's young talent as students from Community High's poetry class share their original work at Bookbound.

The book is wildly ambitious--spanning more than thirty years, its many events seen through the eyes of a dozen different characters--and just as wildly successful. In prose that zips and smarts, taut and electric, Haigh renders every one of her many characters in all their moving and human complexity. The result is a fully realized world, and an unforgettable novel.\u201d\n\nJennifer Haigh returns to the Pennsylvania town at the center of her iconic novel Baker Towers, in this ambitious, achingly human story of modern America and the conflicting forces at its heart.\n\nForty years ago, Bakerton coal fueled the country. Then the mines closed, and the town wore away like a bar of soap. Now Bakerton has been granted a surprise third act: it sits squarely atop the Marcellus Shale, a massive deposit of natural gas. To drill or not to drill?  Prison guard Rich Devlin leases his mineral rights to finance his dream of farming. He doesn\u2019t count on the truck traffic and nonstop noise, his brother\u2019s skepticism or the paranoia of his wife, Shelby, who insists the water smells strange and is poisoning their frail daughter.  Meanwhile his neighbors, organic dairy farmers Mack and Rena, hold out against the drilling\u2014until a passionate environmental activist disrupts their lives.\n\nHeat and Light depicts a community blessed and cursed by its natural resources. Soaring, ambitious, it zooms from drill rig to shareholders\u2019 meeting to the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor to the ruined landscape of the \u201cstrippins,\u201d haunting reminders of Pennsylvania\u2019s past energy booms.  This is a dispatch from a forgotten America\u2014a work of searing moral clarity from one of the finest writers of her generation, a courageous and necessary book.\n\n\u201cHeat and Light achieves pure novelistic virtuosity. It\u2019s brilliant beginning to end.\u201d \u2014 Richard Ford\n\n\u201cHeat and Light is a work of tremendous sweep and ambition, a timely, inventive novel powered by Jennifer Haigh\u2019s remarkable compassion for her characters.\u201d \u2014 Jess Walter, author of Beautiful Ruins\n\n\u201cParagraph by paragraph, the prose is full of marvelous texture and material sensation. Heat and Light is an intricate and ambitious novel, firmly grounded in history and our time. The narrator\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge and keen insights about the physical world and social life make the novel a thrilling page turner.\u201d \u2014Ha Jin, National Book Award-winning author of Waiting\n\nJennifer Haigh is the author of four previous novels: Faith, The Condition, Baker Towers, and Mrs. Kimble, winner of the PEN/Hemingway Award for debut fiction. Her short story collection News from Heaven won the Massachusetts Book Award and the PEN New England Award in Fiction.
