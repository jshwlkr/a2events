Just as much influenced by classic rock & roll, country, Latin and Southern hip hop as they are the Stax/Volt or Muscle Shoals era, The Suffers are bringing a fresh approach to what they have coined Gulf Coast Soul. Late night legend David Letterman proclaimed in early 2015 \"If you cant do this, get out of the business\", let it be known that The Suffers are here to stay! With a year that included performances for NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, Newport Folk Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival and The Late Show, The Suffers have delivered over 150 stirring performances of their signature 3rd Coast Soul sound to thousands of new and old fans alike. The large ensemble packs each position of the rhythm and horn section with a level of talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin's massive voice. The band's sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. Their 2016 self-titled debut album is set to hit shelves on February 12th and will be the continuation of what 2015's Make Some Room EP started. Expect to see the band\u2019s name continue to climb up the tier on posters of the best festivals around!\nhttp://www.thesuffers.com\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor. Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts. Each week a different area restaurant is on-site selling a Sonic Lunch for concert-goers to purchase. Other restaurants offer special discounts for concert-goers to pick up to take to the park.\n\nSonic Lunch concerts are free and suitable for all ages. Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers. As a result, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch has become one of the coolest summer events in Ann Arbor.\n\nUpdates on show and weather\nSonic Lunch on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/soniclunch\nSonic Lunch on Twitter\nhttp://www.twitter.com/soniclunch \n\n\"LIKE\"\nBank of Ann Arbor on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bankofannarbor"}, {"date": "2016-07-14T16:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Local Vendor Fair + Impact Day", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/633840703446368/", "description": "Join us for our vendor fair celebrating our fabulous local vendors!
