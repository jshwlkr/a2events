Untethered explores what bonds truly form a family and how, sometimes, love knows no bounds.\n\nChar Hawthorn, college professor, wife and stepmother to a spirited fifteen-year-old daughter, loves her family and the joyful rhythms of work and parenting. But when her husband dies in a car accident, the \u201cstep\u201d in Char\u2019s title suddenly matters a great deal. In the eyes of the law, all rights to daughter Allie belong to Lindy, Allie\u2019s self-absorbed biological mother, who wants to girl to move to her home in California.\n\nWhile Allie begins to struggle in school and tensions mount between her and Char, Allie\u2019s connection to young Morgan, a ten-year-old-girl she tutors, seems to keep her grounded. But then Morgan, who was adopted out of foster care, suddenly disappears, and Char is left to wonder about a possible future without Allie and what to do about Morgan, a child caught up in a terrible crack in the system.\n\nJulie Lawson Timmer grew up in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. She lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan with her husband, their four teenage children and two rescued dogs. By turns, she is a writer, lawyer, mom/stepmom, and dreadful cook. Five Days Left (Putnam 2014) is her first novel. Her second book, Untethered, will be available June 7, 2016.\n\nEvent date: \nTuesday, June 7, 2016 - 7:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1141498692561970/", "name": "Julie Lawson Timmer", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-06-08T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Literati is delighted to welcome Nathan Bomey in support of Detroit Resurrected: To Bankruptcy and Back.\n\nIn Detroit Resurrected, Nathan Bomey delivers the inside story of the fight to save Detroit against impossible odds. Bomey, who covered the bankruptcy for the Detroit Free Press, provides a gripping account of the tremendous clash between lawyers, judges, bankers, union leaders, politicians, philanthropists, and the people of Detroit themselves.\n\nThe battle to rescue this iconic city pulled together those who believed in its future\u2014despite their differences. Help came in the form of Republican governor Rick Snyder, a technocrat who famously called himself \u201cone tough nerd\u201d; emergency manager Kevyn Orr, a sharp-shooting lawyer and \u201cyellow-dog Democrat\u201d; and judges Steven Rhodes and Gerald Rosen, the key architects of the grand bargain that would give the city a second chance at life.\n\nDetroit had a long way to go. Facing a legacy of broken promises, the city had to seek unprecedented sacrifices from retirees and union leaders, who fought for their pensions and benefits. It had to confront the consequences of years of municipal corruption while warding off Wall Street bond insurers who demanded their money back. And it had to consider liquidating the Detroit Institute of Arts, whose world-class collection became an object of desire for the city\u2019s numerous creditors. In a tight, suspenseful narrative, Detroit Resurrected reveals the tricky path to rescuing the city from $18 billion in debt and giving new hope to its citizens.\n\nBased on hundreds of exclusive interviews, insider sources, and thousands of records, Detroit Resurrected gives a sweeping account of financial ruin, backroom intrigue, and political rebirth in the struggle to reinvent one of America\u2019s iconic cities.\n\nNathan Bomey, a journalist at USA Today, was the lead reporter on Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy and General Motors for the Detroit Free Press.

Laith Al-Saadi was crowned \u201cKing of the Blues\u201d by Guitar Center making him one of the top 4 Blues guitarists in the Country.  Laith has been a staple of the Michigan music scene for most of his adult life.  He has shared the stage with greats like Buddy Guy, BB King, Taj Mahal, Kenny Wayne Shepard, Luther Allison, Son Seals & Johnny Winter.  Laith is one of the best and most polished guitar-driven acts you are likely to find on earth.  In 2013, Al-Saadi teamed up with producer Jeffrey Weber and an all star cast of L.A. session legends to make his third release \"REAL.\". The album was recorded live to 2-track with no edits, overdubs, autotune or compression at the world famous Ocean Way Recording Studios in Hollywood. The album features a dream-band of musicians such as Jim Keltner (Drums), Leland Sklar (Bass), Larry Goldings (Hammond B-3), Jimmy Vivino (Rhythm Gtr/ Backing Vox), Tom Scott (Sax), Lee Thornburg (Tpt), Brandon Fields (Bari Sax), Nick Lane (Trombone / Horn Arranger) and more... \nThe soulful new album harkens back to the great musical traditions of New Orleans and Chicago with a splash of Blues, Country, Gospel, and Roots Rock and is arguably Al-Saadi's best work to date.\nhttp://www.laithmusic.com \n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.
