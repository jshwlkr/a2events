The pieces will be altered and built upon to demonstrate how she makes pots and thinks about design and function. The workshop will also focus on surface design and embellishment using slip trailing, carving and line drawing. Silvie is deeply engaged in practice of making functional pots and the theater and atmosphere of the dining experience. Silvie states: \u201cI am interested in discussing how we learn techniques, develop ideas and evolve as innovators rather than imitators. Ideas come easily, but meaning seems to come in layers over decades of time. It is meaning that gives strength to good ideas.\u201d Silvie invites participants to bring images of their work for discussion and questions and themes that we might discuss and all benefit from. How we evolve as makers in our increasingly technological world is a favorite topic of mine.\n\nSilvie Granatelli received her BFA from Kansas City Art Institute and her MFA from Montana State University. Since 1982 she has maintained a home and studio in Floyd, Virginia. Granatelli exhibits her work throughout the United States. She is a seasoned workshop presenter and teacher having taught students in colleges and art centers throughout the US and abroad.\n\nPlease take a moment to watch this interview with Silvie that is available on her website:\nhttp://silviegranatelli.com/interview/\nView less", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1579703035671405/", "name": "Ceramics Workshop: Sylvie Granatelli", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-10-09T10:00:00-04:00", "description": "Sunday, October 9, 10 a.m.\u201312 p.m. Starting Location: UMMA Store\r\n\nOn Sunday, October 9, UMMA will open from 10 a.m.\u201312 p.m. exclusively for a FREE ASD friendly program allowing families to enjoy art in a fun and welcoming atmosphere.

Even if you are thinking about it, you can click \"Interested\" so you can get updates on this page. Do this by 4:00pm, the day of the show. This does not guarantee you a spot, but not doing it puts you at the bottom of the list.\n- After 4:00pm Sunday, \"show ups\" can \"go up\" only if spots are available.\n- The line-up will be created just before showtime.\n- Those arriving after the line-up is finalized will be given spots as time permits.\n- Length of stage time will depend largely on the turn out, performer's experience, and the show-runner's discretion.\n- As always, if you show up and do not get a spot, you will be put at the top of the list for the next show.\n- Please refrain from bringing alcohol. Beer and wine will be available for purchase. You will need to buy a membership to drink, $2 for the day, or $10 for the whole year. Layout will be basically what we had before in Ypsi, boxes and cans with a container for money. \n\n--- Want to increase your odds of getting a spot? Here's some DO's and DON'T's\nDO . . . . Share this event page with your fans on your fan page, your facebook page, your website, or your tweets, or any other social media.\nDO . . . . Volunteer for less time. If you are willing to do 3 rather than 5, or 4 rather than 7, then you are more likely to get a spot.\nDO . . . . Come to the paid shows.\nDO . . . . Stay for \"meet and greet\" after shows.\nDO . . . . Answer poll questions whenever they appear on the event page.\nDO . . . . Bring people. This is not, I repeat NOT, a \"bringer.\" But if somebody has come to see you, it will be very hard to deny you a spot. In the past, we've had shows where we've added a minute of time for every person the comic brought as a non-performing audience member. Bring three people and a five minute spot becomes an eight minute spot.\n\nContact Mark at: www.facebook.com/marksweetman\n\nChili Challis, former staff writer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and nationally known comedian, writer and teacher says about The UNclub,\n\n\"The ... UNclub IS as close to a pure artist's way of pursuing, grasping and understanding comedy as I have ever known; not to mention it's open and fair to every talent, EVERY talent, even ones right off the street. Comics are allowed to go 'out there' and they're permitted to fail and still be welcomed back. It doesn't get any better than that as far as I'm concerned, and I've been known to be a bit fussy. This special venue is poised for the big wave, it is so ready and worthy of being discovered by an audience...and when they do it will be pure addiction.\"\ufeff", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1762464237317178/", "name": "The UNclub wsg/ Andy Jentzen, at the Madhouse, October 9", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-10-09T21:00:00-04:00", "description": "Reggae Workers of the World\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ReggaeWorkers/?fref=ts\n Vic Ruggiero ( The Slackers), Jesse Wagnerr ( The Aggrolites) and Nico Leonard ( Moon Invaders and The Caroloregians)\n\nDirty Notion\n https://www.facebook.com/DirtyNotion/?fref=ts\n$8\n \nmore tba", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/531633113686471/", "name": "Reggae Workers of the World / Dirty Notion( Scarboni's B Day )", "source": "Facebook"}]
