Seeley Professor of English at Allegheny College. He is the author of the poetry collections After Greece and Goat Funeral. He is also co-translator of The Lions\u2019 Gate: Selected Poems of Titos Patrikios, and the author of Honey, Olives, Octopus: Adventures at the Greek Table. Of Eternity & Oranges, Adam Zagajewski says: \u201cThis is a beautiful collection of poems: half-cryptic, half-open; half based on ancient myths, half on actual life. There\u2019s almost always Greece as the backdrop, olives and the sea but also a human drama. Christopher Bakken proves that what\u2019s ancient is also modern and vice versa. We live between times; only poetry can make it palpable.\u201d\n\nDavid Blair is the author of two previous poetry collections. He teaches at the New England Institute of Art. Another book, Arsonville, is forthcoming. Of his most recent work, Friends with Dogs, Tom Sleigh says: \u201cWhat gives weight and density to David Blair\u2019s remarkable poems is their almost Hardyish sense of regret and loss. So many of his poems are little dramas of what wasn\u2019t said when it should have been said, or of the way celebratory instincts get undermined by the pressures of day-to-day life. I admire the quick shifts in voicing, the way a whole social world becomes revealed in some small characteristic gesture, and how alert Blair is to other people. Very few poets ever achieve this kind of fellow feeling and write about it with such tact and intelligent sympathy.\u201d\n\nCody Walker is the author of Shuffle and Breakdown and the co-editor of Alive at the Center: Contemporary Poems from the Pacific Northwest. His poems have appeared in The Yale Review, Parnassus, Slate, Poetry Northwest, The Hecht Prize Anthology, and the 2007 and 2015 editions of The Best American Poetry; his essays have appeared online in The New Yorker and The Kenyon Review. He lives with his family in Ann Arbor, where he teaches English at the University of Michigan. Of his latest, Mary Jo Salter says: \u201cIn Cody Walker\u2019s The Self-Styled No-Child, the poet-father sings to his new baby (read \u2018Cradle Song\u2019 or \u2018Small Suite\u2019 for perfect little servings of delight), but his childlike playfulness has an internal source, too. The light verses in Walker\u2019s new collection often have dark edges to them (see \u2018The Garden\u2019 or \u2018We Hated Our Lives\u2019), and his social and political satires are unflinching. Still, this word-wizard with a genius for rhyme reminds us of how irrepressibly joy remains.\u201d", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/792881080812626/"}, {"date": "2016-04-08T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Jerusalem Quartet", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Friday, April 8, 2016, 8:00 pm\nRackham Auditorium \n\n\u201cAn absolute triumph.

We hadn\u2019t really thought a whole lot about the session in advance\u2014on tour, your default response to things is \u201clet\u2019s just show up and play\u201d\u2014and we were kind of under the gun time-wise when we got to the club. So we decided to just do it quick and dirty, old-school style. Like the open mic nights I used to play: unamplified guitar and vocals, friends with their axes playing along, arrangements arrived at on the fly and infinitely flexible. Four songs later we felt really inspired\u2014me and Matt played a song or two without anybody else around because we\u2019d gotten down to the basement before the others, the total song choice was strictly \u201cwhat do you figure we should play now?\u201d, the mood was relaxed and free\u2026we loved it. Later that night, we decided to strip down the drum kit to essentials and play a choke-the-motor set echoing and elaborating on what we\u2019d done downstairs: a sort of small-ensemble feel, lower in volume but actually higher in intensity. Like what we do in concentrate. It was one of our two favorite performances of the year, the other being the second night at the Fillmore. It felt like acres of new terrain opening up atop an ancient foundation. As soon as it was over, we all wanted to do it again. So in 2016 we\u2019re taking that set on the road. Not that exact set, obviously; the particulars will vary from night to night. But smaller rooms, audible frequencies, up close and personal: this is the general plan. Making eye contact with people in the back row, being able to go off-mic when I want to and still be heard. Total visibility. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this tour. I love the big album release shows as much as anybody, but that City Winery feel of just playing together with bare essentials in close quarters\u2026there\u2019s nothing like it, and when the whole room locks onto the signal, it\u2019s really special.\nWith: William Tyler\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/581", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/554988117991170/"}, {"date": "2016-04-08T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "White Girl Wasted Part 3 | ft.
