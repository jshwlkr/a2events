Two women, clearly dear friends, decide to swap clothing\u2014one woman is wearing a headscarf and no other adornment, the other more modern attire\u2014and experience what it's like to literally and figuratively walk in each other's shoes.

The family-owned and operated Pio Tosini company has become one of the most credible and sought-after producers of Prosciutto di Parma and has been in operation for over 80 years. There are only four ingredients that go into this ham and they are Italian pigs, salt, air and time. At Pio Tosini, a curing time of over 500 days (more than 100 days longer than typical prosciutto production) allows for slow and even salt penetration, assuring the sweetness of the hams. Each ham is trimmed, deboned by hand and personally selected.\n\nThe roots of the Pio Tosini company run deep and date back to the beginning of the last century (1905) in the heart of northern Italy, where Ferrante Tosini (Pio Tosini\u2019s father) started his business slaughtering pigs and curing his own cuts of pork meat in the back room of the family\u2019s grocery store. After World War I he was assisted by his young son Pio and together they gradually improved the business, experimenting with new processing techniques and curing methods. Today Pio Tosini is still a family company, with Ferrante\u2019s great-grandson and Pio\u2019s grandson Giovanni Bianchi carrying out the traditions of the 111 year old company.\n\nChef Alex and Giovanni have collaborated on a menu that highlights the complex flavors of the ham throughout the meal, each course celebrating the sweetness of the hams. Giovanni will be at the Roadhouse to share his family\u2019s story and lead us through a tasting of these delicious hams.\n\n$80 a person (price includes dinner, tax and gratuity - beverages additional)\n\nAmuse Bouche\nBurrata with Prosciutto and Hazelnut Romesco\n\nAppetizer Course\nTorta Fritta with Prosciutto and Fig Preserves\n\nSoup Course\nFennel Soup with Pecorino and Crispy Prosciutto\n\nEntree Course\nJohn Dory with Potatoes de Parma and Roasted Pepper Coulis\n\nDessert Course\nSweet Ricotta Balls with Maraschino Soaked Orange"}, {"date": "2016-03-22T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/822282524550244/", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Kevin Devine", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n-          March 22 \u2013 Kevin Devine\nKevin Devine is an Ann Arbor-based singer, songwriter and entertainer whose fans range in age from kindergartners to 106- year-olds.
