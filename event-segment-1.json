The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-09-24T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "description": "Come catch these 3 local groove machines at Club Above in Ann Arbor and share in a night of pure jollification. \n\n18+\n$5, $7 under 21\n\nDoors @ 9\nLiquid Monk  9:30-10:15\nMa Baker 10:30-11:45\nChirp 12-end \n\nChirp is a four-piece band that does it's fair share of genre-hopping, but often plays in the styles of progressive rock/funk, and jazz-fusion.

Drawing from her background in Irish dance, and influenced by a diverse musical range from classical to Cape Breton, Aislinn\u2019s distinct style shines through her music in an open and honest way. Known for her syncopated and rhythmic accompaniment, her compositions and arrangements offer a fresh perspective to the Irish music tradition.\n\nRaised immersed in the Irish culture (the shared heritage on both sides of her family) Aislinn learned about Irish customs through dance, music and language lessons. She was drawn to the harp from an early age, and studied with various Irish and Celtic harpers including Janet Harbison and Michael Rooney. Aislinn also spent a semester abroad at the University of Limerick where she worked closely with Irish harper Fionnuala Rooney.\n\nAislinn\u2019s recently released debut solo harp album The Thin Place has been called \u201cstunning, a monumental piece of work from a very talented and driven harper\u201d and \u201cfor a first CD it\u2019s a winner\u201d (Jack Baker of Irish American News). The album blends popular traditional Irish tunes with those less commonly played, and features four of her own compositions including one with the album\u2019s namesake. Joining Aislinn on select tracks are some of Chicago\u2019s finest Irish musicians: Liz Carroll (fiddle), Teresa Shine (fiddle) and John Williams (concertina). Aislinn\u2019s tune The Thin Place and accompanying track is also featured on the Irish Traditional Music Archive\u2019s Newly Composed Tunes and Songs in the Irish Tradition playlist. Listen to a sample here.\n\nFrom performing annually at Irish festivals including the Milwaukee Irish Fest, to private events and traditional Irish music sessions, Aislinn is in high-demand as a performer and keeps a busy schedule. She is a featured musician for the annual iBAM! (Irish Books Arts & Music) Gala Dinner, and played for celebrations honoring the opening of the Ireland: Crossroads of Art & Design, 1690-1840 exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAislinn holds a B.F.A. in Inter-Arts (music and dance), an interdisciplinary major in Ethnic Studies and a certificate in Celtic Studies. She has taught workshops at the Milwaukee Irish Fest School of Music (MIFSM), the Milwaukee Irish Fest Summer School, the Great Lakes Harpers (GLH) Regional Conference, and the Madison Folk Harp Society. Currently Aislinn teaches from her private studio in Chicago and via Skype, is on faculty at the MIFSM, and teaches workshops at the Old Town School of Folk Music.\n\nVisit Aislinn on the web at www.aislinnmusic.com\n\nThis project is partially supported by an Individual Artist Program Grant from the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs & Special Events, as well as a grant from the Illinois Arts Council, a state agency through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1160032467389616/", "name": "Aislinn Gagliardi- Irish Harp Concert", "date": "2016-09-25T17:30:00-04:00"}]
