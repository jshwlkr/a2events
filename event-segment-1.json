For a time, the unshakable yet false belief that she is pregnant again provides relief from all-consuming grief. When her fantasy inevitably clashes with reality, Margo falls into a deep depression requiring admission to a psychiatric unit. Uncertain if the sometimes-chaotic environment there is helping or making her worse, Margo seizes an opportunity to flee. Alone on the city streets, new fantasies propel her to commit a crime with dangerous consequences for herself and others.\n      \nThis stirring portrait by a prominent psychiatrist  of one woman\u2019s psychological unraveling takes readers on a journey across the blurred boundaries between sanity and depression, madness and healing.", "date": "2016-05-24T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/118135448589722/", "name": "Join Us - Book Launch Party for Ann Arbor Author Monica Starkman for Her New Novel 'the end of miracles'"}, {"description": "Our May Artists' Meet & Greet topic is \nHow to Submit Your Artwork to a Show or Gallery.

Elizabeth will be joined in conversation by Heather Ann Thompson, a professor of History and Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan; Reuben J. Miller, an assistant professor at UM's School of Social Work; and Ronald Simpson-Bey, Alumni Associate for Just Leadership USA.\n\nElizabeth Hinton is Assistant Professor of History and African and African American Studies at Harvard University. Hinton\u2019s research focuses on the persistence of poverty and racial inequality in the 20th century United States. In her new book, From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America (Harvard University Press), Hinton examines the implementation of federal law enforcement programs beginning in the mid-1960s that laid the groundwork for the mass incarceration of American citizens. In revealing the links between the rise of the American carceral state and earlier anti-poverty programs, Hinton presents Ronald Reagan\u2019s War on Drugs not as a sharp policy departure but rather as the full realization of a shift towards surveillance and confinement that began during the Johnson administration. Before joining the Harvard faculty, Hinton spent two years as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Michigan Society of Fellows and Assistant Professor in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan. A Ford Foundation Fellow, Hinton completed her Ph.D. in United States History from Columbia University in 2012.\n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, May 25, 2016 - 7:00pm", "date": "2016-05-25T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1758695851043356/", "name": "Elizabeth Hinton"}, {"description": "-$2 wells and $1 shooters before 11pm\n--$2 Bud Light bottles\n--$3 Shock Top pints\n--$3 Malibu Black shots and mixed drinks\n--$5 Soft Parade pints\n\n\n\n\nWildoutWednsdays is here for one thing- to help you get thru that midweek slump!

Hopped entirely with Mosaic, the beer is loaded with citrus and tropical fruit character, with grassy and resinous notes in the background. \n\nTUESDAY:1/6bbl teaser of Sour Sacred Cow. Tart, bitter, and dry. Sneak peak of a new addition to our sour lineup before a full batch is tapped next week\n\nWEDNESDAY: Pin of Euchre Pils dry-hopped with whole flower Cascade.

This cask version is  little softer and nuanced, but with all the loveliness of the Mosaic hops. \n\nSATURDAY: Strawberries & Cream - Cream soda meets fresh-picked strawberry in this juicy rendition of the infamous Strawberry Blonde.
