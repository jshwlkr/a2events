Elizabeth will be joined in conversation by Heather Ann Thompson, a professor of History and Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan; Reuben J. Miller, an assistant professor at UM's School of Social Work; and Ronald Simpson-Bey, Alumni Associate for Just Leadership USA.\n\nElizabeth Hinton is Assistant Professor of History and African and African American Studies at Harvard University. Hinton\u2019s research focuses on the persistence of poverty and racial inequality in the 20th century United States. In her new book, From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America (Harvard University Press), Hinton examines the implementation of federal law enforcement programs beginning in the mid-1960s that laid the groundwork for the mass incarceration of American citizens. In revealing the links between the rise of the American carceral state and earlier anti-poverty programs, Hinton presents Ronald Reagan\u2019s War on Drugs not as a sharp policy departure but rather as the full realization of a shift towards surveillance and confinement that began during the Johnson administration. Before joining the Harvard faculty, Hinton spent two years as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Michigan Society of Fellows and Assistant Professor in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan. A Ford Foundation Fellow, Hinton completed her Ph.D. in United States History from Columbia University in 2012.\n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, May 25, 2016 - 7:00pm", "name": "Elizabeth Hinton"}, {"date": "2016-05-25T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/228993060811676/", "description": "-$2 wells and $1 shooters before 11pm\n--$2 Bud Light bottles\n--$3 Shock Top pints\n--$3 Malibu Black shots and mixed drinks\n--$5 Soft Parade pints\n\n\n\n\nWildoutWednsdays is here for one thing- to help you get thru that midweek slump!

The weeklong tribute provides an opportunity for craft brewers to share their diversity, creativity and passion for the beverage they love with the greater craft beer community. From May 16 \u2013 22, all 50 states will be holding events including exclusive brewery tours, special craft beer releases, food and beer pairings, tap takeovers and more to celebrate the ever-advancing beer culture in the United States.\n \nABC is tapping a limited release brew each day to celebrate. \n\nMONDAY: New beer release!! \"Flower Assembly Pale Ale\" 6.2% ABV 35 IBU. Hopped entirely with Mosaic, the beer is loaded with citrus and tropical fruit character, with grassy and resinous notes in the background. \n\nTUESDAY:1/6bbl teaser of Sour Sacred Cow. Tart, bitter, and dry. Sneak peak of a new addition to our sour lineup before a full batch is tapped next week\n\nWEDNESDAY: Pin of Euchre Pils dry-hopped with whole flower Cascade. An extra flowery, zesty rendition of our classic pilsner. \n\nTHURSDAY: 1/6bbl teaser of Sour Michael Faricy Stout. Age has amplified the chocolate and roast character of this stout. The tartness isn't as intense as many of our sour offerings, but this brew delivers a complex, multi-dimensional brew. \n\nFRIDAY: Flower Assembly pin dry hopped in the cask with more Mosaic. This cask version is  little softer and nuanced, but with all the loveliness of the Mosaic hops. \n\nSATURDAY: Strawberries & Cream - Cream soda meets fresh-picked strawberry in this juicy rendition of the infamous Strawberry Blonde. Smooth scents of vanilla flood the nose and taste buds at first sip, followed by the bite of strawberry and a satisfying finish.. \n\nSUNDAY: VIPA day!!
