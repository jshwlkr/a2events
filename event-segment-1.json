[{"name": "American Craft Beer Week", "date": "2016-05-26T11:30:00-04:00", "description": "For the 11th year in a row, the Brewers Association has declared American Craft Beer Week (ACBW), the nationwide celebration of U.S. small and independent craft brewers. The weeklong tribute provides an opportunity for craft brewers to share their diversity, creativity and passion for the beverage they love with the greater craft beer community. From May 16 \u2013 22, all 50 states will be holding events including exclusive brewery tours, special craft beer releases, food and beer pairings, tap takeovers and more to celebrate the ever-advancing beer culture in the United States.\n \nABC is tapping a limited release brew each day to celebrate. \n\nMONDAY: New beer release!! \"Flower Assembly Pale Ale\" 6.2% ABV 35 IBU. Hopped entirely with Mosaic, the beer is loaded with citrus and tropical fruit character, with grassy and resinous notes in the background. \n\nTUESDAY:1/6bbl teaser of Sour Sacred Cow. Tart, bitter, and dry. Sneak peak of a new addition to our sour lineup before a full batch is tapped next week\n\nWEDNESDAY: Pin of Euchre Pils dry-hopped with whole flower Cascade. An extra flowery, zesty rendition of our classic pilsner. \n\nTHURSDAY: 1/6bbl teaser of Sour Michael Faricy Stout. Age has amplified the chocolate and roast character of this stout. The tartness isn't as intense as many of our sour offerings, but this brew delivers a complex, multi-dimensional brew. \n\nFRIDAY: Flower Assembly pin dry hopped in the cask with more Mosaic. This cask version is  little softer and nuanced, but with all the loveliness of the Mosaic hops. \n\nSATURDAY: Strawberries & Cream - Cream soda meets fresh-picked strawberry in this juicy rendition of the infamous Strawberry Blonde. Smooth scents of vanilla flood the nose and taste buds at first sip, followed by the bite of strawberry and a satisfying finish.. \n\nSUNDAY: VIPA day!! ABC VIPA members receive HAPPY HOUR pricing all day!", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/158066451258466/"}, {"name": "Big Hearts for Seniors presents \"Letter to Anita\"", "date": "2016-05-26T17:30:00-04:00", "description": "5:30-6:15 VIP Reception (Emcee remarks at 6:00)\n6:15 Doors open for general admission\n6:30 George Bedard and the Kingpins perform\n7:00 Movie begins \n(be sure to stick around for closing remarks!)\n\nVIP tickets are $50 (includes a reception with hot/cold hors d\u2019oeuvres, a free drink ticket (beer, wine or soda), cash bar, and meet & greet with Jim Toy and Ronni Sanlo. \n\nGeneral admission seats are $15\n\n Letter to Anita is a riveting portrait of the effects of anti-gay discrimination on families and how one woman found her voice and capacity to forgive as a result.  It provides a historical context for the discrimination that today\u2019s LGBTQ older adults have faced in their lifetimes and, in many cases, continue to face and promises to be be an educational and inspirational evening.  We are excited to welcome Dr. Ronni Sanlo and Mr. Jim Toy as well as feature a special appearance by George Bedard and the Kingpins.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1800637513497391/"}, {"name": "Meet Poet Sarah Sala for a Discussion and Signing of 'The Ghost Assembly Line'", "date": "2016-05-26T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "SARAH SALA is a poet and educator with roots in Brooklyn, Michigan.
