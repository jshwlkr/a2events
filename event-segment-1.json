From the 1970s through the 1990s, changes in Detroit were almost all for the worse, as the built fabric of the city was erased through neglect and abandonment. But over the last decade Detroit has seen the beginnings of a positive transformation, and the photography in Detroit Is No Dry Bones provides unique documentation of the revival and its urbanistic possibilities. Beyond the fate of the city\u2019s buildings themselves, Vergara\u2019s camera has consistently sought to capture the lives of Detroit\u2019s people. Not only has he shown the impact of depopulation, disinvestment, and abandonment during the worst years of the urban crisis, but he has also shown Detroiters\u2019 resilience. The photographs in this book are organized in part around the way people have re-used and re-purposed structures from the past. Vergara is unique in his documentation of local churches that have re-occupied old bank buildings and other impressive structures from the past and turned them into something unexpectedly powerful architecturally as well as spiritually.\n\n\u201cVergara is especially alert to changes in the urban landscape . . . perhaps more people will take a second, closer look at the wealth of native folk art we have all over town. And Vergara deserves thanks for recording them and offering a serious critical appraisal.\u201d\n\u2014Detroit Metro Times\nCamilo Jos\u00e9 Vergara was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow in 2002 and received a Berlin Prize Fellowship in 2010. In 2013, he became the first photographer to be awarded the National Humanities Medal. He is author of numerous books, including Silent Cities: The Evolution of the American Cemetery; The New American Ghetto; and Harlem: The Unmaking of a Ghetto.", "date": "2017-01-25T19:00:00-05:00", "name": "Camilo Jose Vergara: Detroit Is No Dry Bones", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1169444286484219/"}, {"description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

Huron Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.\n\nAn Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared in 2010 to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of proposed improvements to the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport. The proposed improvements focus on shifting and extending Runway 6/24, the primary runway, to address the needs of the existing critical aircraft that use the airport. Alternatives were developed to provide options for extending the existing runway by 795 feet, from 3,505 feet to 4,300 feet, while extending the existing parallel taxiway to the same length.  \n\nThe original 2010 Environmental Assessment has been revised and updated, however the proposed improvements have not changed between the original 2010 EA and the recently revised EA.\n\nThe revised EA is available for public review starting today until February 10, 2017 at the following locations:\nAnn Arbor Municipal Airport\n801 Airport Drive\nAnn Arbor, MI 48108\n\nAnn Arbor Public Library 343 S.

Michigan Avenue\nAnn Arbor, MI 48108\n\nMDOT \u2013 Office of Aeronautics website\nhttp://www.michigan.gov/aero/\n\nThe purpose of the Public Information Meeting is to answer questions regarding the revised EA, or the Preferred Alternative, and to solicit constructive input from interested citizens regarding the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed improvements. Maps, drawings and other pertinent information, including the EA document, will be available for public information. Please take an opportunity to review the EA at one of the locations listed above prior to the meeting as there will be no formal presentation.  Written comments may be submitted during the Public Information Meeting or may be mailed or e-mailed to the following address. All comments must be received by 5:00 p.m. on February 10, 2017 to be included in the study record.\n\nContact Name:\t\tMr. Steve Houtteman\nContact Address:\tOffice of Aeronautics\nMichigan Department of Transportation\n2700 Port Lansing Road\nLansing, MI 48906\nEmail Address: \tHouttemanS@michigan.gov", "date": "2017-01-26T16:00:00-05:00", "name": "Ann Arbor Airport EA Public Information Meeting", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1282795971759170/"}, {"description": "It happens every day, that creeping question that lingers in the back of our minds until we have to figure it out- what's for dinner?!
