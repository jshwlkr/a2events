In those years the concept of Pop was under construction. Subjects addressed in the art\u2014 consumer culture, food and other appetites, technology and the mass media, the Cold War, women\u2019s roles\u2014were live issues at the University. By showcasing artists whose work was too raw or unusual to become part of the later canon, this event helps revise historical understanding of the early 1960s and opens a window into creative life at the University. The symposium will include presentations by noted art historians, followed by a discussion with alumni whose minds were blown as art students at time of the exhibitions.\n\nThis LSA Bicentennial Theme Semester event is presented with support from the U-M College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the University of Michigan Bicentennial Office, and the U-M History of Art Department.

It also offers an unprecedented opportunity to view art that may have never been publicly displayed otherwise\u2014and most certainly, not all together. For visitors, and especially for future Michigan alumni, Victors for Art illuminates the shared passion for art fostered by the Michigan experience.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by Joseph Rosa, Guest Curator, in collaboration with Laura De Becker, Helmut & Candis Stern Associate Curator of African Art, Jennifer Friess, Assistant Curator of Photography, Lehti Mairike Keelman, Assistant Curator of Western Art, and Natsu Oyobe, Curator of Asian Art.\n\nLead support for Victors for the Arts: Michigan's Alumni Collectors is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the University of Michigan Health System, the University of Michigan Office of the President, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs and the National Endowment for the Arts, and the University of Michigan Bicentennial Office.", "name": "Victors for Art: Michigan's Alumni Collectors\u2013Part I: Figuration", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1724899501156129/"}, {"date": "2017-03-18T14:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "FREE\n\nJoin dancers from Kidd Pivot  for an exploration of the company\u2019s movement style.\n\nNo dance training or experience necessary, and all levels, ages 13 and up, are welcome.
