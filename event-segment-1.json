Huron Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.\n\nAn Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared in 2010 to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental aspects of proposed improvements to the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport. The proposed improvements focus on shifting and extending Runway 6/24, the primary runway, to address the needs of the existing critical aircraft that use the airport. Alternatives were developed to provide options for extending the existing runway by 795 feet, from 3,505 feet to 4,300 feet, while extending the existing parallel taxiway to the same length.  \n\nThe original 2010 Environmental Assessment has been revised and updated, however the proposed improvements have not changed between the original 2010 EA and the recently revised EA.\n\nThe revised EA is available for public review starting today until February 10, 2017 at the following locations:\nAnn Arbor Municipal Airport\n801 Airport Drive\nAnn Arbor, MI 48108\n\nAnn Arbor Public Library 343 S.

Michigan Avenue\nAnn Arbor, MI 48108\n\nMDOT \u2013 Office of Aeronautics website\nhttp://www.michigan.gov/aero/\n\nThe purpose of the Public Information Meeting is to answer questions regarding the revised EA, or the Preferred Alternative, and to solicit constructive input from interested citizens regarding the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed improvements. Maps, drawings and other pertinent information, including the EA document, will be available for public information. Please take an opportunity to review the EA at one of the locations listed above prior to the meeting as there will be no formal presentation.  Written comments may be submitted during the Public Information Meeting or may be mailed or e-mailed to the following address.

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing, and performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dance floor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 10 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark and sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, \"The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best, and for me this is the new wave in house music.\" He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater\u2019s booty shake.\n\nGrowing up in Washington DC, Worthy was inspired by the early American rave scene. Upon moving to New York in the late 90\u2019s, he was exposed to artists like LTJ Bukem and Stacey Pullen whose music inspired him to play records across multiple genres, from techno and breaks to hiphop and drum n\u2019 bass. In 2001 he swapped coastlines, moving to San Francisco to pursue his music career. There he teamed up with Claude Von Stroke and Justin and Christian Martin, becoming one of the four founding fathers of the Dirtybird party, Worthy\u2019s breakout track, Irst Te, released on the Dirtybird label in 2007, quickly established his notoriety as a producer. With other bangers like Shy Look, Tric Trac (co-produced with Eats Everything) and the recently release track, Dip, Worthy has been rocking the \u201cDirtybird\u201d sound for nearly a decade now.\n\nConcurrently, Worthy has established his own label, Anabatic Records, which has allowed him to be a bit more experimental with his production, and expand his reach as an artist. Some of the songs that have charted on sites such as Beatport include Concubia, Work The Walls, and Flashin. In 2014 Worthy released his debut full-length album, Disbehave, a genre-defying rebellion against the house producers status quo. Breaking down rules and boundaries, Worthy has sought to set himself apart from the mundane world of expectation, striking out to release something unexpected. Disbehave was accepted with critical acclaim and received notable press attention.\n\nEarly Spring 2015, Worthy will release a two part remix album of Disbehave with artists including Thugfucker, Stanton Warriors, Yolanda be Cool, Matt Tolfrey, and a slough of other amazing producers. He is also back with another Dirtybird release called \"So Delicious\", among other tracks that will be due out later this year.\n\nAbout Golf Clap:  DJs; producers; club headliners; after-party enthusiasts: Golf Clap are Hugh Cleal and Bryan Jones, a Detroit duo with an unmatched passion for house music and a seemingly endless supply of studio and club-focused creativity. And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nWith roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up.\n\nReleases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, Spring Awakening, North Coast, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact.\n\nWhether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San, Skream, or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them.\n\nAs with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans.\n\n2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/djworthysf/videos\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/worthy\nTalk: https://twitter.com/w_o_r_t_h_y\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/WorthySF\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/itsworthy/\n\nDoors at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services available contact: VIP@necto.com \u2022 734-994-5436 \u2022 necto.com", "name": "Worthy with Golf Clap at Necto", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/981986061934932/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2017-01-27T17:00:00-05:00", "description": "Join us every Tuesday for beer and veggies!

I am truly hoping this Ann Arbor iconic venue will remain a concert venue for many years to come.  I have made so many great memories at this venue as a musician and a fan.   I love playing theaters but there is something special about rocking a high energy club.  The thought of not being able to play here again with my busy schedule is alarming to say the least... so I am not going to let that happen.

Without becoming didactic or pedantic about the spiritual metaphor hidden in the concept of the \"bird-while,\" Keith Taylor\u2019s collection evokes certain Eastern meditative poets who often wrote in an aphoristic style of the spirit or the mind mirroring specific aspects of the natural world.\n\nThe Bird-while is a collection of forty-nine poems that meditate on the nature\u2014both human and non-human\u2014that surrounds us daily. Taylor is in the company of naturalist poets such as Gary Snyder and Mary Oliver\u2014poets who often drew from an Emersonian sensibility to create art that awakens the mind to its corresponding truths in the natural world. The book ranges from the longer poem to the eight line, unrhymed stanza similar to that of the T'ang poet Han-Shan. And without section breaks to reinforce the passing of time, the collection creates greater fluidity of movement from one poem to the next, as if there is no beginning or end, only an eternal moment that is suspended on the page. Tom Pohrt\u2019s original illustrations are scattered throughout the text, adding a stunning visual element to the already vivid language. The book moves from the author\u2019s travel accounts to the destruction of the natural world, even species extinction, to more hopeful poems of survival and the return of wildness. The natural rhythm is at times marred by the disturbances of the twenty-first century that come blaring into these meditations, as when a National Guard jet rumbles over the treeline upsetting a hummingbird, and yet, even the hummingbird is able to regain its balance and continue as before. At its core, Taylor\u2019s collection is a reminder of Emerson\u2019s idea that natural facts are symbols of spiritual facts.\n\nKeith Taylor teaches at the University of Michigan. He has published many books over the years: collections of poetry, a collection of very short stories, co-edited volumes of essays and fiction, and a volume of poetry translated from Modern Greek.\n\nTom Pohrt is a self-taught artist who has illustrated numerous books including The New York Times bestseller Crow and Weasel by Barry Lopez. He recently illustrated Terrapin and Other Poems by Wendell Berry and Careless Rambles, a selection of poems by John Clare. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nEvent date: \nFriday, January 27, 2017 - 7:00pm", "name": "Poetry at Literati: Keith Taylor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1194461353983196/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2017-01-27T20:00:00-05:00", "description": "Celebrating 15 years of the annual gala tradition - wine included!\n\nThis year Kerrytown Concert House is pulling out all the stops (and wine bottle corks!) for WWS XV!
