Production dates are March 9-12, 2017 at the Arthur Miller Theatre on UM\u2019s North Campus.\n\nOne cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, while the northern lights hover in the sky above, Almost\u2019s residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Knees are bruised. Hearts are broken. Love is lost, found, and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine will never be the same. \n\nThe show has 19 characters, but the director may double cast roles based on talent at auditions. Those auditioning do not need to prepare anything. Please wear movement clothes. \n\nPLOT AND CHARACTER BREAKDOWN:\n\n\nAlmost, Maine by John Cariani comprises nine short plays that explore love and loss in a remote, mythical almost-town called Almost, Maine. Almost, Maine is a town that\u2019s so far north, it\u2019s almost not in the United States\u2014it\u2019s almost in Canada. And it almost doesn\u2019t exist. Because its residents never got around to getting organized. So it\u2019s just\u2026Almost. One cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, while the northern lights hover in the sky above, Almost\u2019s residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Knees are bruised. Hearts are broken. Love is lost, found, and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine will never be the same. A note about this play from the playwright: \n\n\nThe people of Almost, Maine are not quaint, quirky eccentrics. They don't wear funny clothes and funny hats.  They don't have Maine accents.  They are not \"Down Easters.\"  They are not fishermen or lobstermen.  They don't wear galoshes and rain hats. They don't say, \"Ayuh.\" \n\nThe people of Almost, Maine are ordinary people. They work hard for a living.  They are extremely dignified. They are honest and true.  They are not cynical. They are not sarcastic. They are not glib. But this does not mean that they are dumb.  They're very smart. They just take time to wonder about things.  They speak simply, honestly, truly, and from the heart. They are never precious about what they say or do.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1051418098337234/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Auditions for Almost, Maine", "date": "2016-12-05T14:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "Calling all Ann arbor Beer Lovers!! \n\nThe revered head brewers of Arbor Brewing Company (Chris), Blue Tractor (Pat) and Grizzly Peak (Duncan) joined forces to bring you Washingtonacity, an English Bitter brewed at each location by all 3 brewers.\n\nWe are together hosting a Washington Street pub crawl starting at 5PM Monday, December 5th.

Seating is first-come, first-served.\nPresented by: Swarupa Anila, Director of Interpretive Engagement, Detroit Institute of Arts\n\nAs museums strive to serve broad, ever-diversifying publics, it is no longer possible to deny the ways museums mirror and reinforce racial, cultural, and class inequities of the broader society. Skillful racial and cultural representation in interpretation and programming is not only an intellectual exercise; it is an ethical responsibility that requires fracturing the known through consistent individual and institutional self-reflection and action. This talk focuses on the challenging and often painful internal work toward developing diversity and strategies and actions supporting systemic change in museum representation, interpretation, and ideation.\n\nSwarupa Anila is director of interpretive engagement at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Key issues she pursues in interpretive planning practice include examining whose voices and perspectives are missing in museum interpretation, how to integrate visitor voices to flatten museum and art historical knowledge hierarchies, and how to design museum interpretation that supports dynamic, meaningful visitor engagements with art.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Museum Studies website.\nCo-sponsored by the U-M Museum of Art", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1778744065683778/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "U-M Museum Studies Program Presents: \"Inclusion Requires Fractur", "date": "2016-12-06T18:30:00-05:00"}, {"description": "In his Wine Report 2005, British wine writer Tom Stevenson honored Larry Mawby with the title \u201cfizzmaster exraordinaire\u201d.
