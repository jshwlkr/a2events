He was born and raised in Minneapolis and still lives there with his wife and children. He is the author of multiple award-winning novels.\n\nA highly acclaimed novelist now gives us a true epic: a love story that spans sixty years, generations worth of feuds, and secrets withheld and revealed. \n\nThe two principal stories at play in \"Wintering \"are bound together when the elderly, demented Harry Eide escapes his sickbed and vanishes into the forbidding, northernmost wilderness that surrounds the town of Gunflint, Minnesota instantly changing the Eide family, and many other lives, forever. He d done this once before, more than thirty years earlier in 1963, fleeing a crumbling marriage and bringing along Gustav, his eighteen-year-old son, pitching this audacious, potentially fatal scheme winter already coming on, in these woods, on these waters as a reenactment of the ancient voyageurs journeys of discovery. \n\nIt's certainly something Gus has never forgotten, nor the Devil's Maw of a river, a variety of beloved (possibly fantastical) maps, the ice floes and waterfalls (neither especially appealing from a canoe), a magnificent bear, the endless portages, a magical abandoned shack, Thanksgiving and Christmas improvised at the far end of the earth, the brutal cold and sheer beauty of it all. And men hunting other men. \n\nNow with his father pronounced dead Gus relates their adventure in vivid detail to Berit Lovig, who d spent much of her life waiting for Harry, her passionate conviction finally fulfilled over the last two decades. So, a middle-aged man rectifying his personal history, an aging lady wrestling with her own, and with the entire saga of a town and region they d helped to form and were in turn formed by, relentlessly and unforgettably.", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Peter Geye - Award Winning Author", "date": "2016-07-25T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/259400431102202/", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\nHeather Schwartz \nhttp://www.heatherschwartzmusic.com/\nHeather Schwartz has become known for creating a unique concert experience, with a vintage charm and passionate vocals she truely connects with her audience.

He lives in Vermont.\n\nYou ve seen the headlines: Parmesan cheese made from sawdust. Lobster rolls containing no lobster at all. Extra-virgin olive oil that isn t. Fake foods are in our supermarkets, our restaurants, and our kitchen cabinets. Award-winning food journalist and travel writer Larry Olmsted exposes this pervasive and dangerous fraud perpetrated on unsuspecting Americans. \"Real Food/Fake Food\" brings readers into the unregulated food industry, revealing that this shocking deception extends from high-end foods like olive oil, wine, and Kobe beef to everyday staples such as coffee, honey, juice, and cheese. It's a massive bait and switch where counterfeiting is rampant and where the consumer ultimately pays the price. But Olmsted does more than show us what foods to avoid. A bona fide gourmand, he travels to the sources of the real stuff, to help us recognize what to look for, eat, and savor: genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy, fresh-caught grouper from Florida, authentic port from Portugal. Real foods that are grown, raised, produced, and prepared with care by masters of their craft. Part cautionary tale, part culinary crusade, \"Real Food/Fake Food\" is addictively readable, mouth-wateringly enjoyable, and utterly relevant.
