UM Zell Fellows in Poetry Amanda Rybin Koob and Hannah Webster will also read.\n\n\"Solarium is a completely original gem of a book. I have never met Jordan Zandi, but I would like to, for there is a sweet spirit haunting his guileless poems. His inner world is always interacting with the outer world, and as a result everything seems to be shining. 'Walking across the binary field, / what does the young man see?' Zandi asks, searching for signs with his subtle eyes. The answer seems to be the great opium of simply being content within oneself\u2014with a heart that receives and watches (if a heart watches), while resisting the systems that hurt us\u2014and remaining awake to experience.\"\u2014Henri Cole, from the Foreword  \n\nJordan Zandi is the author of Solarium (Sarabande Books), which was chosen by Henri Cole as the winner of the Kathryn A. Morton Prize. The New Yorker named it one of the twelve best poetry-related books of 2015, calling it, \"A first book made eventful by the weirdness and clarity of Zandi's mind.\" He holds an M.F.A. in poetry from Boston University, where he was an Elizabeth Leonard Fellow and a Robert Pinsky Global Fellow to Bolivia, and his poems have appeared in The New Republic, Little Star, and Verse Daily, among others. He is founder and co-editor of Prodigal, an independent print and online journal of poetry and prose and currently lives in Indianapolis with his wife and their two rabbits.  \n\nEvent date: \nFriday, October 14, 2016 - 7:00pm", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-14T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Poetry at Literati: Jordan Zandi"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/541805179338204/", "description": "Ride the Poto, backwards, at night!

Ryan Packard is known mostly for his extensive work as a composer and percussionist within the thriving contemporary classical scene in Chicago, while Albert Wildeman has achieved fame for his meteoric rise from novice instrumentalist to one of the busiest players in town after relocating to Chicago from the Netherlands in 2011 to immerse himself in the city\u2019s broad-shouldered music world. These two contribute noticeably fresh perspectives to this ongoing and ever-evolving local dialogue, a world of which Rempis has been a flagship member for almost two decades. As a trio, their voice carries a unique shape, combining a love for full-on blasts of energy with a sensitivity to the smallest details, resulting in music that can be a freight train one moment, and an insectoid microcosm the next. The band released their first recording, Polynya, on Aerophonic Records in the summer of 2016, and is on tour throughout North America this fall.\n\nThis performance is made possible through the generous sponsorship of The Maxine and Stuart Frankel Foundation in honor of Maurice and Linda Binkow on the occasion of her 80th birthday and their 60th wedding anniversary.
