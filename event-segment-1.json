No pre-registration is required. All actors cast must attend a mandatory workshop on Saturday, January 7, 2017, from 1-6 pm. Rehearsals begin January 16. Production dates are March 9-12, 2017 at the Arthur Miller Theatre on UM\u2019s North Campus.\n\nOne cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, while the northern lights hover in the sky above, Almost\u2019s residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Knees are bruised. Hearts are broken. Love is lost, found, and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine will never be the same. \n\nThe show has 19 characters, but the director may double cast roles based on talent at auditions. Those auditioning do not need to prepare anything. Please wear movement clothes. \n\nPLOT AND CHARACTER BREAKDOWN:\n\n\nAlmost, Maine by John Cariani comprises nine short plays that explore love and loss in a remote, mythical almost-town called Almost, Maine. Almost, Maine is a town that\u2019s so far north, it\u2019s almost not in the United States\u2014it\u2019s almost in Canada. And it almost doesn\u2019t exist. Because its residents never got around to getting organized. So it\u2019s just\u2026Almost. One cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, while the northern lights hover in the sky above, Almost\u2019s residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Knees are bruised. Hearts are broken. Love is lost, found, and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine will never be the same. A note about this play from the playwright: \n\n\nThe people of Almost, Maine are not quaint, quirky eccentrics. They don't wear funny clothes and funny hats.  They don't have Maine accents.  They are not \"Down Easters.\"  They are not fishermen or lobstermen.  They don't wear galoshes and rain hats. They don't say, \"Ayuh.\" \n\nThe people of Almost, Maine are ordinary people. They work hard for a living.  They are extremely dignified. They are honest and true.  They are not cynical. They are not sarcastic. They are not glib. But this does not mean that they are dumb.  They're very smart. They just take time to wonder about things.  They speak simply, honestly, truly, and from the heart. They are never precious about what they say or do.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1051418098337234/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Auditions for Almost, Maine"}, {"date": "2016-12-04T15:00:00-05:00", "description": "Join us for an afternoon with four local debut Young Adult authors for a discussion and signing. \n\nAuthors participating: Kirstin Bartley Lenz, Heather Smith Meloche, Darcy Woods and Erica M.

She's enjoyed a roaming life with her mountaineering parents, making the natural world her jungle gym, the writings of Annie Dillard and Henry David Thoreau her textbooks. But when tragedy strikes on an Ecuadoran mountaintop, Cara's nomadic lifestyle comes to an abrupt halt. \nStarting over at her grandparents home in suburban Detroit, Cara embarks on a year of discovery, uncovering unknown strengths, friendships, and first love.

He loves the thrill, and each adventure allows a little release because his smug smile and suave demeanor in the face of authority doesn t make life at home with his mom any less tough. He tries to take care of her, but the truth is he's powerless in the face of her fragile mental health. So he copes in his own way, by defacing public property and pulling elaborate pranks, though he knows in the end this ll only screw up his life even more. \n\nAs they both try not to let their self-destructive patterns get the best of them, Tessa and Jack gravitate toward one another, discovering the best parts of themselves in the process. An honest portrayal of the urges that drive us and finding the strength to overcome them, Ripple is a stunning debut from a powerful new voice.\n\n********\nDarcy Woods\n\nDarcy Woods had three big loves in grade school: Reading, writing, and pizza day.
