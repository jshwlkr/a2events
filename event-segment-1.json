He is a cultural and intellectual historian of modern central Europe, focusing on the interplay of ideology and culture in its many forms. He is the author of Prague Territories: National Conflict and Cultural Innovation in Franz Kafka's Fin de Si\u00e8cle (2000),  and co-editor, with Helmut Puff and Dagmar Herzog, of After the History of Sexuality: German Genealogies With and Beyond Foucault (2012). Violent Sensations: Sex, Crime, and Utopia in Vienna and Berlin, 1860-1914 is a study of understandings of urban sex and crime in scientific, police, and popular press representations, and in the articulations of criminal and sexual subjects themselves.\n\nSilke-Maria Weineck is particularly interested in the many ways in which classical literature and philosophy continue to reverberate in the modern world. Her first book, The Abyss Above traces the figure of the mad poet through writings by Plato, H\u00f6lderlin and Nietzsche. The Tragedy of Fatherhood: King Laius and the Politics of Paternity in the West looks at the tensions that have characterized the concept of fatherhood from Sophocles and the Bible over Hobbes to Kleist and Freud. Our Ancient Wars, co-edited with Victor Caston, explores the presence of classical war writing in contemporary cultural production.

September 24 | 8pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nThe Slackers wsg: Duppies\n\nThe Slackers are self styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll from New York City. The Slackers began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan\u2019s lower east side, the band released its debut album, Better Late Than Never, in 1996. The band\u2019s success resulted in the release of a second album, Red Light, on the Epitaph label in 1997. Since then the Slackers have released 11 more studio albums (The Question, Wasted Days, Slackers & Friends, Close My Eyes, Slackers in Dub, Peculiar, Boss Harmony Sessions, Self Medication, Lost and Found, The Great Rocksteady Swindle, and The Slackers [self-titled, 2016] ) 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs (International War Crimminal, My Bed is a Boat), and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 the Slackers have played over 100 shows every year in a total of 46 american states, 7 Canadian provinces, 22 European countries, 5 Latin American countries, and 2 Asian countries. The band\u2019s musical style is distinct from their contempories; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50\u2019s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term \u2018Jamaican Rock\u2019nRoll.\u2019 to describe it. He says, \u201cThe band might play a classic Jamaican style but the vocals are distinctly American east coast, revealing the obvious connection of Jamaican music to the Doo-Wop of Harlem and the Bronx.\u201d With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, the Slackers have successfully used crowdfunding (www.bigtun.es/theslackers.) to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/671", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/992824104100196/", "name": "The Slackers 9/24/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}]
