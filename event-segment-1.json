Wiggins is the author of The Joy of Physics (with cartoons by Sidney Harris) and the coauthor, with Charles M. Wynn Sr., of the The Five Biggest Ideas in Science, Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction, The Five Biggest Unsolved Problems in Science, and the textbook Natural Science: Bridging the Gaps. Wynn and Wiggins have also edited And God said, \"Let There Be Evolution!\u201d: Reconciling the Book of Genesis, the Qur'an and the Theory of Evolution. Wiggins is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Physics, Oakland Community College in Michigan.\n\nThis lively and humorous book focuses attention on the fact that \"science is a human enterprise.\" The reader learns about the foibles and quirks as well as the admirable ingenuity and impressive accomplishments of famous scientists who made some of the greatest discoveries of the past and present. Examples abound: James Watson and Francis Crick formed a legendary partnership that led to the discovery of DNA, but they essentially ignored the contribution of female colleague Rosalind Franklin. Later, in the race to sequence the human genome, Watson criticized J. Craig Venter's technique as a process that could be run by monkeys. Nikola Tesla once worked for Thomas Edison, but then quit after a dispute about a bonus. Robert Hooke accused Isaac Newton of stealing his ideas about optics. Plato declared that the works of Democritus should be burned. With tongue-in-cheek illustrations by renowned science cartoonist Sidney Harris, this book takes the reader behind the scenes of scientific research to shine new light on the all-too-human people who do science.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-12T15:00:00-04:00", "name": "Meet Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Physics & Author Arthur Wiggins for a Discussion & Signing of 'The Human Side of Science'"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/235874080125426/", "description": "Thursdays through Sundays June 9-26.
