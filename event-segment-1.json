He begins his story in 1982, when he was a first-year Duke student; grief-stricken after his girlfriend\u2019s death, he decided to go on a study abroad trip to the country. Returning after graduation to pursue his journalistic dreams, Savitt finds himself in the midst of historic news stories. The book vividly describes his 17 years of knowing China as intimately as an American can, during which he sees its cultural and economic flowering. He also observes the Tiananmen Square massacre, where he dodges bullets and fights the urge to participate, not just witness. His creation of China\u2019s first independent English-language newspaper gets him noticed, first by the Beijing bureaus of Western media outlets and then by the Communist Party. He comes across as a risk taker whose wealthy family back home could only help him so much\u2014his activist reporting style eventually leads to solitary confinement and a hunger strike. Savitt is a smart, thrilling memoirist, but his book is not just a narrative roller-coaster ride: readers will receive a new understanding of what has happened in China over the past 30 years, from someone who stood shoulder to shoulder with students asking for a better country.\" \u2014 Publishers Weekly (http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59376-652-8)", "name": "Scott Savitt Discussion & Signing for 'crashing the party'", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-01T19:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1816181065293764/"}, {"description": "Join us on Wednesday November 2nd at 6pm for a 2 hour workshop on the fundamentals of using Spritekit to develop games for Apple's Mobile platform.

A 19th-century minister builds an elaborate motor that will bring about the Second Coming. A man with rough hands locks a boy in a room with an albino ape. An apocalyptic army falls under a veil of forgetfulness. The story of Red Riding Hood is run through a potentially endless series of iterations. A father invents an elaborate, consuming game for his hospitalized son. Indexes, maps, a checkered shirt buried beneath a blanket of snow: they are scattered through these pages as clues to mysteries that may never be solved,  ingering evidence of the violence and unknowability of the world. A Tree or a Person or a Wall brings together Bell\u2019s previously published shorter fiction\u2014the story collection How They Were Found and the acclaimed novella Cataclysm Baby\u2014along with seven dark and disturbing new stories, to create a collection of singular power.\n\n\u201cThese fables plumb the depths of human longing\u2026 a collection that resonates like a tuning fork, lingering after the book is closed.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly\n\n\u201cA clutch of stories with a flavor of the experimental, the apocalyptic, and often both\u2026Admirable efforts to strip familiarity and sentiment from stories of humanity at its worst.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews\n\n\u201cTold in a mythic, \u00adomniscient voice, some of these pieces read like cruel fairy tales\u2026 Imagine a tale from Lydia Davis on a bad trip\u2026 smart and edgy.\u201d\u2014Library Journal\n\nMatt Bell is the author of the novels Scrapper and In the House Upon the Dirt Between the Lake and the Woods, which was a finalist for the Young Lions Fiction Award, a Michigan Notable Book, and an Indies Choice Adult Debut Book of the Year Honor Recipient, as well as the winner of the Paula Anderson Book Award.
