Fascinated by the simple aesthetic, the craftsmanship, and the makers\u2019 unassuming personalities and ways of life, Holmes visited many kiln towns to photograph and interview the artists and collect ceramic wares of various shapes and techniques. She donated a significant portion of her collection to UMMA in 2013.\n\nRichly introduced in this presentation are works by ceramic artists emerging in the late 1960s and the early 1970s in the town of Mashiko, two hours north of Tokyo by train. Mashiko became an international mecca of folk ceramics after Hamada Sh\u014dji (1894\u20131978), a major figure of Japan\u2019s Folk Craft (Mingei) Movement, set up his studio there in 1930. Hamada\u2019s idea of ceramic making for a new age, which combined the aesthetic of folk ceramics and the modern concept of the studio artist, attracted many younger artists of unconventional backgrounds, including women.", "date": "2016-08-19T11:00:00-04:00", "name": "In Focus: Modern Japanese Folk Ceramics", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/170729440003602/"}, {"description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "date": "2016-08-19T15:00:00-04:00", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/161265737615035/"}, {"description": "Bring your well-worn items that could use a tune up, and we'll take a look at them! \n\nOr, make someone else's day by volunteering at Fix-It Friday and repairing their items.\n\nFix-It Friday:\nThink of this as the last chance before you get rid of something; Free, but no Guarantee.\n\nWe will:\n- try to diagnose what is wrong\n- tell you if we think we may be able to fix it today\n- tell you if you'll need a part, and where you might be able to get it\n- try to fix it to the best of our ability, but in the limited time we have\n\nHowever, we may not be able to fix it.
