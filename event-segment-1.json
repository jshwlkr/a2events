Upon its release in May 2015, \u201cFull Circle\u201d was supported by a national tour, along with radio airplay in 11,000 retail stores, commercial radio airplay in 5 midwest states, and airplay on 200+ college radio stations.\nDollar says, \u201cWhen I listen to the latest batch of The Outer Vibe productions, I feel like I'm on a vacation I don't want to leave. The guitars feel like a Cheshire smile on a sunny beach, the drums beat like perfect waves on the shore. Everything stays glued together with sticky-sweet vocals, trumpets sounding from the west, and bass sounds that walked down from another planet. All at the same moment providing reflection and rejoice.\u201d\n\u201cFull Circle\u201d is a follow-up to their 2012 album \u201cHoka Hey\u201d, which independently achieved much success, achieving top 5 request at radio in Michigan, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas and licensing from ABC News\u2019s \u201cGood Morning, America\u201d and West Michigan\u2019s Baker College in 2013.\nhttps://theoutervibe.com\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor.

The Studebaker family, with a tradition of blacksmithing, began building wagons in South Bend, Indiana in 1852, and eventually became the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles. Early in the 20th century they added electric, and then gasoline powered, vehicles (initially produced in Detroit). Studebaker was the only wagon and carriage manufacturer to successfully transition to motor vehicles into the modern era, ending production of automobiles in 1966. Though always outpaced by the Big Three financially, Studebaker often exhibited daring and ground breaking design, especially after World War II. One model, the Avanti, was so well regarded that it continued in production by various independent successor companies into 2006. This display will showcase vehicles dating back to 1880 all the way up to 2002.\n\nAwards judged by Bill Crispin Chevrolet and other Show sponsors presented at 7 pm at the corner of Main and Liberty.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1629489244034490/", "name": "Rolling Sculpture Car Show"}, {"date": "2016-07-08T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Literati is thrilled to launch the latest issue of the Michigan Review of Prisoner Creative Writing, produced by the Prison Creative Arts Project.
