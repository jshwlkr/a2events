Wolverine gives us a slightly more centralized location to our geographically diverse membership and is very close to the highway.  \n\nAt this meeting we'll be discussing the status of and plans for Waterloo, of course.  We'll also give updates on new events (Brecfest, the Tri Chapter Challenge and Youth Riding Day) as well as talk about the 2016 schedule for all of our traditional events.

He is also a three-time winner of the prestigious Gerald Loeb Award for Excellence in Financial Journalism.\nBorn in 1961, Bryan was raised in Temple, Texas, and graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1983. From 1983 to 1992 he was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, where he reported from Dallas, Houston, Pittsburgh and, during the late 1980s, covered the busy mergers and acquisitions beat in New York. He has written for Vanity Fair since 1992.\nIn 1990 Bryan and John Helyar co-authored Barbarians, the story of the fight for control of RJR Nabisco. The book, which spent 39 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has been hailed as one of the most influential business narratives of all time. Bryan joined Vanity Fair in 1992, where he has reported from locales as diverse as Hollywood, Nepal, Moscow, Tokyo and Jerusalem.\n\nFrom the bestselling author of Public Enemies and The Big Rich, an explosive account of the decade-long battle between the FBI and the homegrown revolutionary terrorists of the 1970s\nThe Weathermen. The Symbionese Liberation Army. The FALN. The Black Liberation Army. The names seem quaint now, when not forgotten altogether. But there was a stretch of time in America, roughly between 1968 and 1975, when there was on average more than one significant terrorist act in this country every week, and the FBI combated these groups and others as nodes in a single revolutionary underground, dedicated to the violent overthrow of the American government.\n\nBenefiting from the extraordinary number of people from the underground and the FBI who speak about their experiences for the first time, Days of Rage is filled with important revelations and fresh details about the major revolutionaries and their connections and about the FBI and its desperate efforts to make the bombings stop. The result is mesmerizing and completely new\u2014a book that takes us into the hearts and minds of homegrown terrorists and federal agents alike and weaves their stories into a spellbinding secret history of the 1970s.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-07T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Meet Author & Journalist Bryan Burrough for a Discussion of 'Days of Rage'"}]
