This stunning visual display illuminates a virtually unknown type of art, one that will charm and intrigue both those familiar and unfamiliar with Tibetan art. For Tibetan Buddhists, books are a divine presence in which the Buddha lives and reveals himself, and they are venerated and handled with the utmost respect. The exhibition features 33 book covers dating from the eleventh to the eighteenth century that represent the glorious iconographic array and non-figural decoration typical of these sacred items. UMMA docents will explore the construction of these hand-held relief sculptures and the images depicted, most commonly deities, important teachers, mantras, and sacred symbols.", "name": "Guided Tour Protecting Wisdom: Tibetan Book Covers from the Mac"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-02-05T16:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1713140125617477/", "description": "Winners of the grand prize at the inaugural M-Prize Chamber Music Competition at the University of Michigan in May, the Calidore String Quartet is \u201ca miracle of unified thought,\u201d (La Presse, Montreal).\n\nhttp://ums.org/performance/calidore-string-quartet/", "name": "Calidore String Quartet"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-02-05T18:30:00-05:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1323412567725529/", "description": "Join us this Sunday at the Brewpub to watch the game!
