This exhibition features works collected by a diverse group of alumni and the artworks themselves span 3,500 years of art making, from ancient sculptures to multimedia works by emerging artists. Victors for Art offers visitors an unprecedented opportunity to view art that may have never been publicly displayed otherwise\u2014and most certainly, not together. Presented in two parts\u2014Figuration (February 18-June 11, 2017) and Abstraction (July 1- October 29, 2017) this first part, Figuration will presents art across a wide range of media, time periods, and geographies including works by artists as diverse as Christo, Jean Dubuffet, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and Elizabeth Vigee\u0301 Le Brun, among others. By assembling these seemingly disparate works and displaying them alongside one another, the scope of what is encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d is explored and revealed, even as its meaning continues to evolve today.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by Joseph Rosa, Guest Curator, in collaboration with Laura De Becker, Helmut & Candis Stern Associate Curator of African Art, Jennifer Friess, Assistant Curator of Photography, Lehti Mairike Keelman, Assistant Curator of Western Art, and Natsu Oyobe, Curator of Asian Art.\n\nLead support for Victors for the Arts: Michigan's Alumni Collectors is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the University of Michigan Health System, the University of Michigan Office of the President, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs and the National Endowment for the Arts, and the University of Michigan Bicentennial Office.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/248475528931412/", "name": "Guided Tour: Victors for Art"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-02-26T14:00:00-05:00", "description": "Featuring \nRandy Napoleon \nRick Roe\nSean Dobbins \nPaul Keller \nPaul Finkbeiner", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/424265344632355/", "name": "Celebrating the music of Louis Smith "}]
