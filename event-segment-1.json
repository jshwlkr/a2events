Michigan\u2019s Joshua Davis was raised in the folk tradition: the music, the social movements, the land.   He writes songs that blend the roots of American music with gritty rock n' roll and vintage soul.   For over 15 years Joshua has made his living sharing his songs, stories and knowledge across the US and Canada at festivals, concert halls, coffeehouses and dives - as a solo act, front man for roots ensemble \"Steppin' In It\", classic swing band \"Shout Sister Shout\", songwriter showcase band \"The Starlight Six\" and frequently as a workshop facilitator, presenter or instructor. \nhttp://www.joshuadavismusic.com \n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor. Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts.

Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers.

In these true stories, writers and their loved ones struggle as their worlds are upended. What do you do when your father kills himself, or your mother is committed to a psych ward, or your daughter starts hearing voices telling her to harm herselfor when you yourself hear such voices? Addressing bipolar disorder, OCD, trichillomania, self-harm, PTSD, and other diagnoses, these stories depict the difficulties and sorrows--and sometimes, too, the unexpected and surprising rewards--of living with mental illness.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nJennifer Metsker lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan where she is the Writing Coordinator at the Stamps School of Art and Design. Her poetry, which often addresses issues related to mental illness, has appeared or is forthcoming in many journals including The Cincinnati Review, Cimarron Review, Gulf Coast, The Seattle Review, Whiskey Island, Rhino, Cream City Review, and Birdfeast. She has written art reviews for Arthopper and Carbon Culture and recently was awarded the Third Coast Audio Shortdoc Prize for an audio piece that she created with artist Stephanie Rowden. \n\nMadeline Strong Diehl has worked as a magazine journalist, editor, and grant writer for almost 30 years. She has won the T.S. Eliot poetry prize from the University of Kent at Canterbury and published a book of poetry, Wrestling with Angels (2013). Her comedies have been produced Off-Broadway and around the Midwest, and she has published dozens of humorous essays, believe it or not.", "name": "Madeline Diehl & Jennifer Metsker"}, {"date": "2016-08-04T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/212274295832362/", "description": "Kuebler Langford Nature Area is a 31-acre park tucked into a sharp curve of Huron River Drive.
