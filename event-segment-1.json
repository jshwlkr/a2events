[{"description": "Friday, January 6 | 9pm | 18+ | $10 adv./ $12 day of\n\nGolf Clap\nwsg: Ghita Sisters\n\nGolf Clap are Hugh Cleal and Bryan Jones, a Detroit duo with an unmatched passion for house music and a seemingly endless supply of studio and club-focused creativity. And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started. With roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up. Releases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact. Whether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them. As with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans. 2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.", "date": "2017-01-06T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1195526610494635/", "name": "Golf Clap w/ Ghita Sisters 1/6/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"description": "COLD-PRESSED JUICE CLEANSES ARE BACK!\n\n... and just in time for the New Year!

Positive that dimensions were colliding and that he could literally feel the deepest will of some mystic past, he decided not to ignore these voices but to contemplate their input, and thus Interdimensional Transmissions came to fruition and the idea-based project Ectomorph found a true home. Since then the vision has continually grown organically and mutated into something that is hard to describe yet easy to feel. His sets effortlessly combine a multitude of seemingly disparate genres into a coalescing solid sound system sensation - pure transcendent psychedelic wizardry. \n\nAlso Featuring:\n\nUnofficial: Matilda\n\nDoogatron\n\nPAT in the HAT\n\n7$\nLocated @ Club Above (Above the Heidleberg) Ann Arbor, MI.", "date": "2017-01-07T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1654083548217903/", "name": "BMG at The Club Above w/ Matilda // Doogatron // Pat in the Hat"}, {"description": "Kabuki actors were superstars in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan.

This event will take place in the Rackham Amphitheater and is free and open to the public. Join us!\n\nIn a series of personal letters to his sons, Omar Saif Ghobash offers a short and highly readable manifesto that tackles our current global crisis with the training of an experienced diplomat and the personal responsibility of a father. Today's young Muslims will be tomorrow's leaders, and yet too many are vulnerable to extremist propaganda that seems omnipresent in our technological age. The burning question, Ghobash argues, is how moderate Muslims can unite to find a voice that is true to Islam while actively and productively engaging in the modern world. What does it mean to be a good Muslim?\n\nWhat is the concept of a good life? And is it acceptable to stand up and openly condemn those who take the Islamic faith and twist it to suit their own misguided political agendas? In taking a hard look at these seemingly simple questions, Ghobash encourages his sons to face issues others insist are not relevant, not applicable, or may even be Islamophobic. These letters serve as a clear-eyed inspiration for the next generation of Muslims to understand how to be faithful to their religion and still navigate through the complexities of today's world. They also reveal an intimate glimpse into a world many are unfamiliar with and offer to provide an understanding of the everyday struggles Muslims face around the globe.\n\nOmar Saif Ghobash is the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Russia. In addition to his post in Moscow, Ambassador Ghobash sponsors the Saif Ghobash-Banipal Prize for Arabic Literary Translation and founded the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in collaboration with the Booker Prize in London. Ambassador Ghobash studied law at Oxford and mathematics at the University of London.\n\nDavid Serio is an Education and Public Programming Specialist at the Arab American National Museum (AANM).  He holds a M.A. in Near Eastern Studies and Arabic from Wayne State University.  Mr. Serio joined the AANM in January of 2011, initially as an AmeriCorps, later being hired as a full-time Educator and Public Programmer.  As an Educator and Public Programmer, Mr. Serio has conducted educational presentations and workshops throughout the Mid-West.  Mr. Serio also helps in the planning and implementation of youth programs and cultural events.  Mr. Serio is also the Curator of the Arab Film Festival and manages all of the AANM\u2019s film programming, both at the AANM and at offsite locations around the world.  Mr. Serio is also the Volunteer Coordinator and responsible with growing and managing the volunteer program.  Mr. Serio continues to implement educational and cultural programming to audiences far and wide. \n\nEvent date: \nMonday, January 9, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nRackham Amphitheater\n915 E.
