In this propulsive, masterfully plotted epic, an urban wasteland whose history is plagued with riots and unrest is reimagined as an ambiguous new frontier\u2014a site of tenacity, possibility, even hope. Driven by struggle and suspense, and shot through with a startling empathy, Christopher Hebert\u2019s magnificent second novel unspools an American story for our time.\n\n\u201cA humbler, more endearing bunch of rainbow-hued misfits never fumbled their broken-hearted way towards revolution than those we meet in Christopher Hebert\u2019s Angels of Detroit\u2013truly a novel of our moment, both in the way it stares unsentimentally at the real trouble we are in\u2013a world of poisoned children and cities in ruins\u2013and in the deep and detailed empathy it shows for characters of every class and provenance. Hebert gets Detroit right, in this beautifully made book: his careful drawing of its physical catastrophe locates the city at the exact boundary between gritty-real and surreal, between last hope and post-apocalyptic nightmare.\u201d\u2014Jaimy Gordon, author of the National Book Award-winning Lord of Misrule\n\nChristopher Hebert is the author of the novels Angels of Detroit and The Boiling Season, winner of the 2013 Friends of American Writers award. He is also co-editor of Stories of Nation: Fictions, Politics, and the American Experience (forthcoming from UT Press). His short fiction and nonfiction have appeared in such publications as FiveChapters, Cimarron Review, Narrative, Interview, and the Millions. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan and is editor-at-large for the University of Michigan Press. Currently he lives in Knoxville, TN, where he is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Tennessee.\n\n*\n\nMargaret Lazarus Dean's Leaving Orbit: Notes from the Last Days of American Spaceflight won the Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize. In the 1960s, humans took their first steps away from the earth, and for a time our possibilities in space seemed endless. But in a period of austerity and in the wake of high-profile disasters like Challenger, that dream has ended. In early 2011, Margaret Lazarus Dean traveled to Cape Canaveral for NASA\u2019s last three space shuttle launches in order to bear witness to the end of an era. With Dean as our guide to Florida\u2019s Space Coast and to the history of NASA, Leaving Orbit takes the measure of what American spaceflight has achieved while reckoning with its earlier witnesses like Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, and Oriana Fallaci. Along the way Dean meets NASA workers, astronauts, and space fans, gathering possible answers to the question: what does it mean that a spacefaring nation won\u2019t be going to space anymore?\n\n\u201cMargaret Lazarus Dean is that rarest of hybrids, the dearest of hyphenates. She brings to science such exquisite sentence making, to futurism the sound anchorage of the past, to space travel the tidings of personal journey. Journalist, essayist, memoirist and storyteller\u2014her prized text shows Americans, each and every, how we came to be the ones we are. And where we\u2019re going. This is rocket science, reliable witness, replete with poetry.\u201d\u2014Thomas Lynch, author of The Undertaking\n\nMargaret Lazarus Dean received a BA in anthropology from Wellesley College and an MFA from the University of Michigan. She is the author of the novel The Time It Takes to Fall and the recipient of fellowships from the NEA and the Tennessee Arts Commission.

On one side, the wealthy wield power and advantage, wittingly or not, to keep the system operating in their favor\u2014all while retreating into enclaves that separate them further and further from the poor and working class. On the other side, those who find it increasingly difficult to keep up or get ahead lash out\u2014waging a rhetorical war against the rich and letting anger and resentment, however justifiable, keep us from seeing new potential solutions.\n\nBut can we suspend both class wars long enough to consider a new way forward? Is it really good for anyone that most of society\u2019s wealth is pooling at the very top of the wealth ladder? Does anyone, including the one percent, really want to live in a society plagued by economic apartheid? It is time to think differently, says longtime inequality expert and activist Chuck Collins. Born into the one percent, Collins gave away his inheritance at 26 and spent the next three decades mobilizing against inequality. He uses his perspective from both sides of the divide to deliver a new narrative. Collins calls for a ceasefire and invites the wealthy to come back home, investing themselves and their wealth in struggling communities.  And he asks the non-wealthy to build alliances with the one percent and others at the top of the wealth ladder.\n\nStories told along the way explore the roots of advantage, show how taxpayers subsidize the wealthy, and reveal how charity, used incorrectly, can actually reinforce extreme inequality. Readers meet pioneers who are crossing the divide to work together in new ways, including residents in the author\u2019s own Boston-area neighborhood who have launched some of the most interesting community transition efforts in the nation. In the end, Collins\u2019s national and local solutions not only challenge inequality but also respond to climate change and offer an unexpected, fresh take on one of our most intransigent problems.\n\n\u201cI have never read a story remotely like the one Chuck Collins has to tell. Born to the one percent, in circumstances few of us can imagine, he grew an outsized conscience and gave up his inherited wealth for a life of fighting the vicious inequality that is destroying our country. Somewhere along the way, he came to understand that the rich can be part of the solution instead of the problem and started organizing them to join in the struggle for a fair economy. The result is an electrifying challenge to the affluent as well as the one percent. \u2018Come out of your gated communities and gated hearts,\u2019 he writes, because outside lies the warmth of human solidarity.\u201d--Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed\n\nChuck Collins is a researcher, campaigner, storyteller, and writer based at the Institute for Policy Studies where he co-edits Inequality.org. He has written extensively on wealth inequality in previous books like 99 to 1, Wealth and Our Commonwealth (with Bill Gates Sr.), and Economic Apartheid in America as well as in The Nation, The American Prospect, and numerous other magazines and news outlets. Collins grew up in the 1 percent as the great grandson of meatpacker Oscar Mayer, but at age 26 he gave away his inheritance. He has been working to reduce inequality and strengthen communities since 1982 and in the process has cofounded numerous initiatives, including Wealth for the Common Good (now merged with the Patriotic Millionaires), United for a Fair Economy, and Divest-Invest. He is also a leader in the transition movement, and a co-founder of the Jamaica Plain New Economy Transition and the Jamaica Plain Forum, both in the Boston-area community in which he lives.", "date": "2016-09-28T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Chuck Collins", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/179229159178583/"}, {"description": "We're bringing the Painting With Dreams tour to Necto Nightclub in Ann Arbor!\n\nNew album, a brand new stage production, and most important, all of our Tritonians of Michigan under one roof!!!!\n\nMore info and tickets - http://paintingwithdreams.com/\n\nSee you this fall!", "date": "2016-09-28T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Tritonal: Painting With Dreams - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1731098520471774/"}]
