That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single, \"Brand New Key,\" topped the charts in 1971.\nWith guitar in hand and a combination of amazing vocal talent, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear at the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her.\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, and written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.\nThis is a rare opportunity to experience Melanie live and in person in an intimate venue.

At age seven she was put on the boys' soccer team. At age thirty five she would become the highest goal scorer--male or female--in the history of soccer, capturing the nation's heart with her team's 2015 World Cup Championship. Called an inspiration (and \"badass\" by President Obama), Abby has become a fierce advocate for women's rights and equal opportunity, pushing to translate the success of her team to the real world. As she reveals in this searching memoir, Abby's professional success often masked her inner struggle to reconcile the various parts of herself: ferocious competitor, daughter, leader, wife. \n\nWith stunning candor, Abby shares her inspiring and often brutal journey from girl in Rochester, New York, to world class athlete. Far more than a sports memoir, Forward is gripping tale of resilience and redemption and a reminder that heroism is, above all, about embracing life's challenges with fearlessness and heart.\n\nAbout the Event\n\nFeaturing a conversation with Doug Tribou, host of Morning Edition for Michigan Radio, and former reporter and producer for NPR's Only A Game, this event will take place at Rackham Auditorium on September 17th, 2016, at 7pm. Doors for seating will open at 6:15pm. There are two ticket options: a $10 dollar general admission ticket, and a $30 dollar general admission and hardcover book bundle. Though both ticketing options provide general admission seating, book-bundle ticket holders will have first access to the signing line following the event. Book-bundle ticket holders will pick up their books at the event, and not before. Additional copies of Forward will be available to purchase in the lobby, including a young reader's edition.\n\nGeneral admission ticket holders may also have books signed, and are asked to join the signing line after book-bundle ticket holders. Due to time constraints, Abby will only be signing books. There will no posed photographs during the signing (though you are welcome to take pictures while you are in the signing line). Books will not be personalized.", "date": "2016-09-17T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/130844247363538/", "name": "Abby Wambach"}]
