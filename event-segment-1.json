His investigations into form and materials have led him to continually explore the parameters of two\u2013 and three\u2013dimensional space. In 1967 Stella began a thirty\u2013year creative collaboration with master printer Ken Tyler and his Los Angeles workshop. Stella and Tyler inspired and challenged each other to move in exciting new artistic directions. The Museum was recently gifted three exceptional prints that developed out of this historic partnership. Based on Stella\u2019s paintings from the Notched-V series, they reflect the artist\u2019s signature geometric style of the 1960s, during which he eschewed illusionistic space, choosing instead large\u2013scale, shaped canvases that tightly frame the composition. The prints are both optical and tactile: The ink rises from the paper and the slightly rough lines reveal the artist\u2019s hand.\n\nThis work was recently gifted to UMMA by Marsha Vinson and Marvin Rotman and will be on display till April 23, 2017.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/712053682285362/", "date": "2017-01-17T11:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "African American Special Dinner: Biscuits for Your Outside Man", "description": "Biscuits for Your Outside Man: A Fundraiser Dinner for the Music Makers Relief Foundation\n\nThough the Blues has had an enormous impact on American music, many of the form\u2019s most influential artists have struggled behind the scenes. In 1994, Tim and Denise Duffy started the Music Makers Relief Foundation to provide financial support to Southern working class musicians, ensuring that their legacies and music will be preserved. Limited by age and abject poverty, many of these artists have almost given up hope when instead they should be celebrated and recorded into history.\n\nJust like the Music Makers have brought back musicways embedded in American roots, Zingerman\u2019s Roadhouse has strived to connect with foodways that are steeped in American culture. Chef Alex Young has collaborated with our special guest, Music Makers member Dom Flemons from The Carolina Chocolate Drops, to create a dinner that reflects the music of the very artists the foundation has helped promote. Come by and taste the BBQ that Drink Small praises in his song, \u201cLiving in a BBQ World\u201d, and the buttery biscuits that Algia Mae Hinton sings about in \u201cBiscuits for your Outside Man\u201d. The Music Makers Relief Dinner on Tuesday, January 17th, will be an opportunity to enjoy great food, hear soulful music, and to help protect expressive talent by purchasing tickets to a truly remarkable event.\n\nTo hear the songs we will feature at the dinner, follow this link: \n\nhttp://musicmaker.bandcamp.com/album/biscuits-for-your-outside-man", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1720937631566664/", "date": "2017-01-17T18:00:00-05:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Zell Visiting Writers Series: Kelly Link, Distinguished Writer", "description": "Kelly Link is the author of the collections Stranger Things Happen, Magic for Beginners, Pretty Monsters, and Get in Trouble.
