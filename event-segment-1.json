Tickets and information are available online at www.a2ct.org, through the A2CT office at 734-971-2228, or at the door of the theater before each performance.\n\nGenerally considered one of the best screen-to-stage musical adaptations, The Wedding Singer is based on the hit movie of the same name. It's 1985 and rock-star wannabe Robbie Hart is New Jersey's favorite wedding singer. He's the life of the party, until his own fiancee leaves him at the altar. Shot through the heart, Robbie makes every wedding as disastrous as his own. Enter Julia, a winsome waitress who wins his affection. As luck would have it, Julia is about to be married to a Wall Street shark, and unless Robbie can pull off the performance of a decade, the girl of his dreams will be gone forever. Director Ron Baumanis says of the show \u201cit\u2019s sort of a \u2018Grease-celebrating-the-80s\u2019 that\u2019s melodic and very, very funny.\u201d\n\nMusic direction for The Wedding Singer  is by Jim Territo, with choreography by Patricia Mazzola.
