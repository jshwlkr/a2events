We're on a mission.\nTo help EVERY entrepreneur find their voice and OWN IT in 2017. Everybody has a unique vision that needs a compelling message. But before that happens, you need support to make it happen. The support will come from others who are exploring the same thing and fussing with the same challenges. Together we will shift and evolve out them. So, every third Wednesday of each month, a tribe of innovators, dreamers and all-around rabble rousers will gather to talk about:\n\n- Breaking through\n- Finding traction\n- Discovering our voice\n\nOn the 21st, we'll have our first gathering, a pre-flight, if you will, to help you define your mission in 2017. It's a low-stress, high impact experience. We'll talk about the tools that we'll be using on our journey and go over any of your questions. You'll receive your link to the private Facebook group as well.\n\n\"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\" -Maya Angelou\n\nLet's get 'it' done in 2017.\n\nWe're proud of you and guess what...
