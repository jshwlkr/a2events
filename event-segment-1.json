By inclination a voracious reader and by profession a librarian, Shelley looked for a good novel about the Buddha . When she didn\u2019t find one that satisfied her, she had the notion to write her own based on the spiritual struggles of women in the Buddha\u2019s time, set in the fascinating world that gave birth to yoga and Buddhism. Steeped in India\u2019s myths and legends, this novel is fresh territory for Western readers of fantasy and historical epics. Through its strong female characters, it will appeal to readers of historical fiction with a woman\u2019s perspective. Light refreshments. Signing to follow.\n\nMore about the book:\nA beautiful warrior princess. A tormented prince. A terrible choice between love, duty, and spiritual freedom.\n\nRebellious Dhara runs away from her Himalayan clan to study with the powerful yogi Mala, a mysterious woman with a violent past. Flung by war onto an adventure-filled journey, Dhara meets and captures the heart of Siddhartha, whose skill in the martial arts and extraordinary mental powers equal her own.\n \nWorldly power and pleasure seduce Dhara, creating a chasm between her and her husband, who longs to follow a sage\u2019s solitary path. She takes on the warrior\u2019s role Siddhartha does not want, and when she returns wounded from battle court intrigue drives them further apart. As Siddhartha\u2019s discontent with royal life intensifies, Dhara\u2019s guru Mala, who has returned to her life as a ruthless outlaw queen, seeks her former pupil for her own evil purposes. \n \nDhara\u2019s and Siddhartha\u2019s love keeps evil at bay, but their son\u2019s birth brings on a spiritual crisis for the prince.  If he leaves his kingdom to seek enlightenment, he turns his back on love and duty and risks destroying his people. Only Dhara can convince him to stay.", "date": "2017-03-03T19:00:00-05:00", "name": "Book Launch: The Mountain Goddess with Shelley Schanfield"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1093572227425292/", "description": "In a career that spans 23 albums and includes three Grammy awards, Tom Chapin has covered a lot of creative ground. In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse.  www.tomchapin.com", "date": "2017-03-03T20:00:00-05:00", "name": "Tom Chapin at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/657765481078555/", "description": "SUBSONNIK INVITES YOU !!!\nCelebrate our Record Release Party with Us bringing you the best entertainment to kick off your weekend! \nHosted at Club Above, Ann Arbor, expect to hear a dynamic range of genres, Open kitchen and Drink Specials served all night long.\n\n--- L i n e U p ---\nVest And Tyler\nhttps://soundcloud.com/vestandtyler\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/glitch/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/vestandtyler/\n\nCurtis Wolfe (L.O) Operator of Statik Records   \n[b2b] Mushkilla\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LODeepHouseMusic/\nhttp://popmuzik.se/2016/02/dj-l-o-not-without-my-coffee/\nhttps://www.beatport.com/artist/l-o/465288\nhttps://soundcloud.com/mushkilla\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DJMushkilla/\n\nTek - Mazter\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tek-mazter\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tek.mazter/\n\nQUENAUDON [b2b] Dan Ryan\nhttps://soundcloud.com/itsquenaudon\nhttps://soundcloud.com/quenaudon-remixs\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Quenaudon/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheRealDanRyan/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/apollo-671613041\n\nCody Popov (CHERRYZ)\nfacebook.com/cody.popov.5\nsoundcloud.com/cherryzofficial\n\nGrab your tickets at the door!!!\n$5 (21+)\n$7 (18+)\n\nSponsored By: SUBSONNIK and Statik Records\nwww.wearesubsonnik.com\nhttp://statikrecords.com/", "date": "2017-03-03T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Subsonnik Takeover"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1839182856327434/", "description": "In honor of Women's History Month, Vault of Midnight will be donating the profits from sales of the amazing Bitch Planet Vol. 1 to Planned Parenthood for the entire month of March. \n\nHave you read Bitch Planet?
