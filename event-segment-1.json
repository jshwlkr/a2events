We brewed up our award winning Old Ale, Jackhammer, and aged it in new white oak. The beer\u2019s chocolate and cherry character is broadened and accented by the wood, producing additional notes of marshmallow, candied pecan, and toffee, with a warming alcohol finish. Release on the first match of the 2016 season. \n\nNext up is the Treebeard Strong Pale Ale. This resinous and dank SPA is straight out of the tropical forest with notes of mango, pineapple and orange citrus. It has woodsy, piney and light biscuity finish with a lingering yet smooth bitterness. We like to consider ourselves modern day hippies at ABC so when we have a chance to raise a glass, or better, brew a beer, in honor of Arbor Day, we will take it!\n\nCheers to tree's, Ann Arbor, Soccer and of course, outstanding local craft beer!", "date": "2016-04-29T11:30:00-04:00", "name": "Arbor Day Beer Releases", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1770822083146908/"}, {"description": "http://cafegive.com/make_the_match/boaa-volunteermatch\nWe believe everyone should have the chance to make a difference.
