The beautiful hills, trees and farmsteads of Southern Michigan with its small farming heritage appear prominently in Nancy's artwork. No two farms are alike in their arrangement of buildings, encouraging endless design possibilities. She works with the light, shadow, and shapes of these pastoral scenes, familiar homes for people and their animals. Having worked and lived on farms most of her life, she uses energetic line, color and texture to evoke a rich experience within this changing rural culture. Her work appears in many local and national exhibits where she has won numerous awards and has achieved signature status in the Pennsylvania Watercolor Society.", "date": "2017-01-12T17:00:00-05:00", "name": "Nancy Feldkamp Exhibit Opening"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/756730994483756/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Mary Szybist is most recently the author of Incarnadine, winner of the 2013 National Book Award for Poetry.

Known for their viral remixes of \u201cTrap Queen\u201d, \u201cI Miss You\u201d and \u201cCool\u201d, the two have, in unprecedented time, mastered a wide range of genres from deep, melodic house to harder progressive cuts. With their Spotify and SoundCloud views now exceeding 35 million and with nineteen #1\u2019s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America. \n\nKicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Blink 182, Tori Kelly and Alesso to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct \u201cSoul House\u201d style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release. After receiving the \u201cAward of Independent Excellence\u201d from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey\u2019s hit \u201cBorn To Die\u201d scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014.\n\nFollowing multiple performances at San Francisco\u2019s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York\u2019s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Denmark, Mexico and Canada, showing off their potential in the international arena.\n\nWith support now coming from the likes of Tiesto, The Chainsmokers, Krewella and many more, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2016, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/user/TwoFriendsMusic\nListen: https://soundcloud.com/two-friends\nTalk: https://twitter.com/twofriendsmusic\nMeet: https://www.facebook.com/twofriendsmusic\nPeek: https://www.instagram.com/twofriendsmusic/\n\nDoors open at 9pm \u2022 18 & over welcome with proper ID \u2022 VIP services are available. contact: VIP@necto.com", "date": "2017-01-12T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Two Friends at Necto"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/230775294023258/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Now playing through January 8!
