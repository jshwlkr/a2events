The low-resolution LEDs create a tension between representation and abstraction, provoking viewers to interpret visual information on their own. In the three-channel video, It\u2019s My Island, Laitinen builds his own island in the Baltic Sea by dragging two hundred sand bags into the water over a period of three months. The work explores ideas of nationality, citizenship, and identity as the artist creates his own single-citizen micro-nation. Lemercier\u2019s computer-generated print Landform uses patterns of black dots and projected light to create the illusion of three-dimensionality and movement when seen from a distance. The effects are more realistic than a still image, butstill unsettlingly artificial. Silva\u2019s Render Garden explores the digitized landscape, including remix and glitch aesthetics, through software that endlessly generates new plant combinations.\n\nThroughout the next year, UMMA will present three exhibitions drawn from the Borusan Contemporary Art Collection in Istanbul. The Borusan\u2019s 30-year-old collection includes significant works across a variety of genres, and since 2011 it has focused on media arts. The works exhibited here address formal concerns such as abstraction and color, and conceptual topics such as identity or ecological issues; many represent traditional categories such as portraiture and landscape that find new resonance when explored through the strategies of dynamic technology.\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by Susan and Richard Gutow Fund, the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment, and the University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities and Penny W.

From the earliest days of classical music through the development of jazz and the other musics of the Americas, composer-improvisors have created repertoire that became the musical literature of each era. Mehmari carries this tradition forward into the 21st century and will show listeners the beauty of improvised music throughout history in solo piano performance. He is regarded as an artistic leader in his native Brazil and is winner of major awards in both classical and popular music.\n\nThis program was developed with support from the Catskill Jazz Factory.\n\n\"Andr\u00e9 Mehmari is one of those musicians with a prodigious talent, who flashes across the stratosphere once in a lifetime.\"\n- Raul d'Gama, Latin Jazz Network\n\n\"His fingers, well trained to navigate the piano keyboard, can do just about anything. Want speed? Power? Elegance? Lyricism? Experimentation? This guy does it all.\"\n- Adam Parker, The Post and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina)\n\n\"Pianist Andr\u00e9 Mehmari is a precocious genius, an extraordinary talent of vibrant and generous imagination. He uses his classical training to approach popular music ... in a rich and creative way, making the formality of one language work for the enrichment of the other.\u201d\n- Mauro Dias, O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil)\n\nTickets:\nAssigned Seats in Rows 1-2 - $30\nAssigned Seats in Rows 3-5 - $20\nGeneral Admission - $15\nStudent General Admission - $5 (w/valid ID)", "name": "Pianist Andr\u00e9 Mehmari: Improvisation through the Ages"}, {"date": "2016-07-30T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1616853798644437/", "description": "Ann Arbor Festival of Song presents the Twenty-Third Annual\nWeek After Art Fair Song Fest\n\nWednesday though Friday, July 27-29, 2016\nKerrytown Concert House\nwww.kerrytownconcerthouse.com    (734-769-2999)  \n415 N.
