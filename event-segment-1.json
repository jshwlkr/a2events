And with releases on some of the world\u2019s most influential house labels already under their belts, along with a lauded Boiler Room session and beyond, they\u2019re only just getting started. With roots in the Detroit underground, booking local and international DJs to play at their own parties, Golf Clap have established themselves as in-demand artists and performers in their own right, via an irresistible combination of hard work, talent and consistently being the last guys standing, wherever the party ends up. Releases on Simma Black, their own Country Club Disco imprint, and Kerri Chandler\u2019s Madtech have announced Golf Clap as a musical force to be reckoned with, however it\u2019s behind the decks where they truly come into their own. They are regulars at esteemed clubs such as Output in New York, Primary in Chicago, and Grasshopper Underground in Detroit. They have also performed at Movement, Electric Forest, Mysteryland, and Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, and are adept at crafting highly creative, energetic sets across four decks: masters of live remixing, tweaking and layering up effects and of teasing out the music for maximum dancefloor impact. Whether they\u2019re playing clubs, warehouse shows, or at an impromptu after-party \u2013 which they more than likely arranged themselves \u2013 the sheer love these guys have for playing records and making people dance is evident. Just ask Lee Foss, Shiba San or any of the other DJs who\u2019ve shared the decks with them for a B2B session: Golf Clap can mix it with the very best of them. As with every movement worth being a part of, Golf Clap\u2019s self-made community started small: a group of like-minded artists and fans giving one another exactly what they needed to throw incredible parties. But as their profile has increased, word has spread both across the US and internationally. Go to any electronic music festival now and you\u2019ll find a strong showing for their Country Club Disco merchandise and an ever-growing army of fans. 2016 has already seen the release of yet more essential Golf Clap material, including remixes for Simma Black and Sleazy G, original productions \u2018All You Need\u2019 and \u2018Feel It\u2019 on Country Club Disco and most recently their remix of Skapes \u2018Deeper Love\u2019. Add to this a flourishing gig schedule, including a European tour, and 2016 looks set to be a landmark year for the boys from Detroit.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-01-06T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "Golf Clap 1/6/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1195526610494635/"}, {"description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.

Positive that dimensions were colliding and that he could literally feel the deepest will of some mystic past, he decided not to ignore these voices but to contemplate their input, and thus Interdimensional Transmissions came to fruition and the idea-based project Ectomorph found a true home. Since then the vision has continually grown organically and mutated into something that is hard to describe yet easy to feel. His sets effortlessly combine a multitude of seemingly disparate genres into a coalescing solid sound system sensation - pure transcendent psychedelic wizardry. \n\nAlso Featuring:\n\nUnofficial: Matilda\n\nDoogatron\n\nPAT in the HAT\n\n7$\nLocated @ Club Above (Above the Heidleberg) Ann Arbor, MI.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-01-07T21:00:00-05:00", "name": "BMG at The Club Above w/ Matilda // Doogatron // Pat in the Hat", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1654083548217903/"}, {"description": "Kabuki actors were superstars in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan.
