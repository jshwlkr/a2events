They were admired by passionate fans with an insatiable appetite for images of them, fed by a publishing industry that mass-produced colorful woodblock prints of actors on stage that could be cheaply purchased as souvenirs of or substitutes for a theater experience. Japanese Prints of Kabuki Theater from the Collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Art presents a selection of these dramatic prints that connected fans to their idols, including off- or backstage portrayals that satisfied fans\u2019 voyeuristic curiosity about their favorite actors\u2019 lives, fantasy scenes of actors in unlikely groupings, and even death portraits of especially famous actors. \n\nThis introduction to the visual culture \rkabuki theater includes prints by major artists such as Utagawa Toyokuni (1769\u20131825), Utagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131865), Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797\u20131861), and Toyohara Kunichika (1835\u20131900).\rLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the National Endowment for the Arts, the William T. and Dora G.

They play original and traditional music in a variety of forms \u2013 original musical settings of a broad array of poetry, original instrumental pieces, and traditional Irish tunes and songs. This unique collaboration brings out qualities in both of these seasoned musicians that you may not have heard from them before.  Their music is rendered with lush beauty, sensitivity and humor on an unusual array of strings  -- various guitars in varied tunings, mandola, mandolin, bouzouki, cittern, tenor guitar -- and their blended voices.\n\n They take the name Noctambule, French for 'night-owl,\u2019 from a Robert Service poem about a nocturnal ramble through the back alleys of Paris, which they have set to music and included on their acclaimed CD Travel in the Shadows.  Their first CD together, it explores many forms of the \u2018night journey\u2019 in song, offering the traveler the opportunity to see and experience things differently once the usual sources of light have been extinguished.  They have selected a broad variety of \u2018noctambulatory\u2019 verse from Tennyson, Neruda, Roethke, St. Vincent Millay, and Robert Service. In addition, they include two original instrumental pieces \u2013 a reel and a waltz \u2013 as well as one traditional Irish song. \n\n BRUCE VICTOR is an eclectic and accomplished guitarist and composer, who plays several different guitars in several different tunings. Seemingly resisting any single musical genre, he has been labeled a 'poly-stylist\u2019 by one of the editors of Acoustic Guitar magazine. He has played with The Sirens of San Francisco, The Triplicates, and as a solo performer.  He was the founder of The Acoustic Vortex, a non-profit musical organization that produced house concerts, mentored youth performers, and performed benefit concerts for other non-profit organizations.  He is also a practicing psychiatrist and was a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n MARLA FIBISH is well known in the Irish music world, bringing a musicality and excitement to the tradition that is seldom heard on the mandolin.  She is also known for her compositions, musical settings of poetry and instrumental pieces that have been featured in her work with Out of the Rain, and Three Mile Stone, and on her acclaimed instrumental recording with Jimmy Crowley, The Morning Star. In addition to the mandolin, Marla brings mandola, tenor guitar, bouzouki, accordion, and her alto voice to the Noctambule sound.\n\nPack something warm, and come prepared for adventure ....\n\nVisit Noctambule on the web at http://www.noctambulemusic.com/", "name": "Noctambule - In Concert", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1357192890965241/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-10-16T18:00:00-04:00", "description": "Our annual awards event, the Civvies, is coming up!
