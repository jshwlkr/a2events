On paper, these prints, watercolors, and drawings by artists such as Piranesi, Kirchner, Grosz, Schiele, and Klimt depict the continent\u2019s people and places with a focus on the physical and psychological human imprint. However, these works also encourage a deeper viewing experience that engages with the expressive capacities of line and its ability to articulate the seen, as well as the unseen, such as larger socio-political and artistic contexts.

Enter, at this particularly challenging moment, a miraculous email: can\u2019t go, it\u2019s all paid for, just book a flight to Miami. Thus began a journey that would lead to the Bahamas and to David Pinder, a legendary bonefishing guide. Bonefish are prized for their elusiveness and their tenacity. And no one was better at hunting them than Pinder, a Bahamian whose accuracy and patience were virtuosic. He knows what the fish think, said one fisherman, before they think it. By the time Dombrowski meets Pinder, however, he has been abandoned by the industry he helped build. With cataracts from a lifetime of staring at the water and a tiny severance package after forty years of service, he watches as the world of his beloved bonefish is degraded by tourists he himself did so much to attract. But as Pinder\u2019s stories unfold, Dombrowski discovers a profound integrity and wisdom in the guide\u2019s life.\n\n\"A brilliant book. Destined to be a classic.\"\u2014Jim Harrison\n\nBorn in Michigan, Chris Dombrowski earned his MFA from the University of Montana. His publications include two collections of poems, By Cold Water (2009) and Earth Again (2013). His poetry and nonfiction have been widely published in leading journals and magazines.
