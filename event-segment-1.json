[{"source": "Facebook", "name": "Comics Unbound: Artist Reception", "description": "Join us for the Public Artist Reception of COMICS UNBOUND on Friday, June 17, from 6 to 9 pm.  \n\nCurated by Anne Drozd and Jerzy Drozd, Cartoonist\n\nThis is a FREE event. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing to think about what our minds do when we read comics. When we regard a single image it may convey some meaning, but the moment we place another image next to it--even a very different one--our minds begin to construct narrative between those two images. Most of the narrative found in comics happens in the reader\u2019s mind, prompted by deft choices made by the cartoonist author.\n\nHOW MIGHT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMICS CHANGE IF WE WERE MORE AWARE OF THE THINKING WE\u2019RE DOING WHEN READING THEM?\n\nComics Unbound explores how cartoonists use shape, size, line, color, and context to activate the readers\u2019 imaginations and invite them into the partnership of comics narrative. Pages are removed from their intended context, that of the graphic novel or comic book, and re-contextualized with the materials that went into making the final pages. Sketches, notes, scripts, and tools are displayed alongside the final artwork. This new context reveals what is usually an invisible narrative in comics--the journey from artist\u2019s vision to clear transmission of meaning.\n\nThe exhibition runs June 10 to June 24 (the public artist reception is June 17)\n\nThis exhibition contains pieces by cartoonists appearing at the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival held at the Ann Arbor District Library June 18 and 19, 2016.\n\nCURATOR BIOS:\n\nJerzy Drozd is one of the artists of The Warren Commission Report. He leads cartooning classes for children, teens, and adults, as well as for teachers who want to bring comics to the classroom. He co-founded the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival and serves as the event\u2019s programming coordinator. Drozd wrote and drew the graphic novel The Front, has worked on Antarctic Press\u2019s Ninja High School and PPV: Pay- Per-View, and has drawn special projects for Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, Marvel Comics, VIZ Media, and others.\n\nAnne Drozd is a librarian and artist. She and her husband Jerzy created Tiny Astronaut Press, to create many space-themed art works, including Rocketosaurus, a fanciful comic for young readers about an Apollo crew. As a librarian at the Ann Arbor District Library, she develops arts programming and has drawn instructional comics for the science tools collection. Anne and Jerzy live in Ann Arbor with their two cats.\n\n-------------\nIn partnership with Ann Arbor District Library\n\nCatering generously provided by Laura's Catering (http://laurascatering.com/)", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/230585263967439/", "date": "2016-06-17T18:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Shakespeare in the Arb 2016 Love's Labour's Lost Week 2", "description": "Thursdays through Sundays through June 26.
