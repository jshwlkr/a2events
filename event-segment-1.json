We hope to reschedule soon, and will announce the new date via our email newsletter.\n\nLiterati welcomes Bill Ayers to Ann Arbor as part of a national tour to celebrate the release of his latest book, Demand the Impossible!: A Radical Manifesto.\n\nDemand the Impossible! is a manifesto for movement-makers. In an era defined by mass incarceration, endless war, economic crisis, catastrophic environmental destruction, and a political system offering more of the same, radical social transformation has never been more urgent. Demand the Impossible! urges us to imagine a world beyond what this rotten system would have us believe is possible. In critiquing the world around us, insurgent educator and activist Bill Ayers uncovers cracks in the system, raising our sights for radical change, and envisioning strategies for building a movement to create a more humane, balanced, and peaceful world.\n\n\"For Bill Ayers, it is the freedom of our collective imagination that links the contemporary world\u2014ensconced as it is in pervasive militarism, racist violence, and environmental devastation\u2014to the flourishing of our planet. This is a manifesto that should be read by everyone who wants to believe that \u201canother world is possible.\u201d\u2014Angela Y. Davis, author of Abolition Democracy and Freedom is a Constant Struggle\n\n\"With huge numbers of us recognizing the need for transformative change, this ambitious and exuberant book perfectly matches its historical moment. Ayers fearlessly confronts the intersecting crises of our age\u2014endless war, surging inequality, unchecked white supremacy and perilous planetary warming\u2014while mapping emancipatory new possibilities. From the first page, his courage is contagious.\"\u2014Naomi Klein, author of This Changes Everything and The Shock Doctrine\n\n\"Demand the Impossible is more than a book, more than a manifesto. It is a torch. Bill Ayers\u2019 vision for a humane future is incendiary\u2014fire that incinerates old logics and illuminates new paths. If we do not end the violence of militarism, materialism, caging, dispossession, debt, want, ignorance, and global warming, our very survival is impossible. Read aloud.\"\u2014Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams\n\nBill Ayers is a social justice activist, teacher, Distinguished Professor of Education (retired) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of two memoirs, Fugitive Days and Public Enemy.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, October 31, 2016 - 7:00pm", "name": "Canceled: Bill Ayers", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-31T19:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1085363878179621/"}, {"description": "Mon.
