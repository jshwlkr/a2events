In Norwegian folklore, it is a spirit who sometimes appears as a white horse that steals children away. In Nathan Hill\u2019s remarkable first novel, a Nix is anything you love that one day disappears, taking with it a piece of your heart. It\u2019s 2011, and Samuel Andresen-Anderson\u2014college professor, stalled writer\u2014has a Nix of his own: his mother, Faye. He hasn\u2019t seen her in decades, not since she abandoned the family when he was a boy. Now she\u2019s reappeared, having committed an absurd crime that electrifies the nightly news, beguiles the internet, and inflames a politically divided country. The media paints Faye as a radical hippie with a sordid past, but as far as Samuel knows, his mother was an ordinary girl, who married her high-school sweetheart. Which version of his mother is true? Two facts are certain: she\u2019s facing some serious charges, and she needs Samuel\u2019s help.\n\nTo save her, Samuel will have to embark on his own journey, uncovering long-buried secrets about the woman he thought he knew, secrets that take him across generations and countries, and stretch all the way back to Norway, the original home of the mysterious Nix. In doing so, Samuel will not only confront Faye\u2019s losses, but also his own lost love, and relearn everything he thought he knew about his mother, and himself. From the suburban Midwest to New York City to the 1968 riots that rocked Chicago, and beyond, The Nix explores\u2014with sharp humor and a fierce tenderness\u2014the resilience of love and home, even in times of radical change\n\n\"The Nix is a mother-son psychodrama with ghosts and politics, but it\u2019s also a tragicomedy about anger and sanctimony in America. Even the minor characters go to extremes\u2014among them, a Home Ec teacher from Hell and an unrepentant plagiarist with presidential aspirations. \u2018A maestro of being awful,\u2019 the son calls his mom. \u2018Every memory is really a scar,\u2019 she tells him. For this mother and son, disappointment is \u2018the price of hope\u2019\u2014a cost they will both bear. Nathan Hill is a maestro of being terrific.\" \u2014 John Irving\n\n\"Pay attention. This is what a Great American Novel looks like. The Nix is culturally relevant, politically charged, historically sweeping, sad, full of yearning, sometimes dark but mostly hilarious. Nathan Hill is a literary powerhouse who will deservedly earn many comparisons to John Irving and Jonathan Franzen.\" \u2014 Benjamin Percy\n\n\u201cOnce in a while a novel arrives at the perfect moment to reflect, skewer, and provide context for the world as we know it. This\u2014now\u2014is that novel.\u201d \u2014 Christina Baker Kline\n\nNathan Hill's short stories have appeared in The Iowa Review, AGNI, Gulf Coast, The Denver Quarterly, Fugue, The Gettysburg Review, and many other journals.

His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers.

Many of these characters live in a utopian future of instant connection and technological gratification that belies an unbridgeable human distance, while others inhabit a post-collapse landscape made primitive by disaster. Children of the New World grapples with our unease in this modern world and how our ever-growing dependence on new technologies has changed the shape of our society.
