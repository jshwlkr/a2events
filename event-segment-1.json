He wrote his first raps at the age of six and hasn't looked back since. Born in Illinois but moved to Arizona in high school, Futuristic's flow seems to be just as hot as his surroundings. His album \"The Rise\" released on May 12th 2015 debuted at #2 on itunes and #9 on Hip-Hop Billboard charts. He has been touring virtually non-stop over the last 2 years headlining his own tours and supporting bigger acts such as Somo & Machine Gun Kelly. His fast witty lyrics mixed with substance and relatable subject matter has gained him a die hard fan base called WTFGang which stands for \"We're The Future\". As an independent artist Futuristic takes pride in his creativity and versatility using his words to inspire his fans and let them know that anything is truly possible but also gives them music to BANG with the top down in the summer. Moving forward he expects to be exactly what he named his lead single from his album.... \"The Greatest\". Futuristic recently was featured on A Great Big World single \"Hold Each Other\" which has led him to National television performances on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, VH1 Streamy Awards, Performing for the Vice President Joe Biden & CEO of Apple Time Cook, for the HRC National Dinner in Washington D.C.\n\nGood music arguably comes from a place that is insightful, meaningful and modern.This is where the living weirdo known as Devvon Terrell lives and sleeps. Hailing from Brooklyn, New York the singer has his own urban style and sound that is a testament to his generation.\n\nDevvon Terrell took the internet by storm, showcasing his talent on various remixes and cover videos on youtube that have gained him as much as 200,000 views on a single video.\n\n \n\nDevvon Terrell wears a variety of hats to translate his music to his audience. From shooting and editing videos to engineering, mixing and mastering all of his music. This jack of all trades mentality has earned him placements with And One Live, C2C Dj Khaled's Halftime Report, a number one Mixtape on Datpiff.com and countless other mediums. Devvon Terrell recently released his first album titled \"Weird Sexy Cool\" and earned a the spot of top 16 albums on the itunes RNB charts. With all his endeavors on the rise Devvon Terrell will surely make the transformation from local talent, to mainstream superstar.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1042945595776720/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Futuristic and Devvon Terrel 4/17/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-18T12:00:00-04:00", "description": "FRESH + FIT!\nStarting April 1, babo and FitPoint want to help you optimize your diet and fitness.

The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/769930223136488/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2016-04-19T09:00:00-04:00", "description": "Oats & Woes & Babo, Oh My!\n\nBabo presents Oats & Woes Ann Arbor a local oatmeal pop-up!

A Pittsburgh native, Moore has been a human jukebox in dive bars, a songsmith on festival stages, and a hootenanny revivalist. Eric\u2019s stellar fingerstyle work bumps down the jagged, thorny backroads of the Mississippi delta and skips over the seas to the British Isles. \n\nWhile he was working as a river guide in Grand Teton Nat\u2019l Park, he frequented the  legendary Hootenanny at Dornans in Jackson Hole, WY. The Hoot\u2019s mandate on traditional music was a scourge to many a songwriter, but not so for Moore. He began a spirited inquiry into acoustic guitar styles and the pre-war songbook. Taking cues from players like Bert Jansch, John Martyn, Archie Fisher and the Delta Blues great Tommy Johnson, Moore brings fresh arrangements and decades of performing experience to his spirited originals and traditional music from both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1699294757015373/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Eric Moore"}, {"date": "2016-04-19T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Can you feel it?
