Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II.\nFor this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body\u2019s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist. Her grandfather\u2019s role in the history of the site underscores Ruben\u2019s personal connection.\nThe exhibition presents Ruben\u2019s photographs of Willow Run in UMMA\u2019s Photography Gallery and an original film\u2014co-created by Ruben and video artist Seth Bernstein and featuring an original score by award-winning composer Stephen Hartke\u2014in the Museum\u2019s Forum.\n\nLead support for Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Herbert W. and Susan L.

This two-part exhibition (Part I: Figuration followed by Part II: Abstraction on view July 1\u2013 October 29) presents works collected by a diverse group of alumni that represent the breadth of the University and over seventy years of graduating classes. The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vige\u0301e Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d. It also offers an unprecedented opportunity to view art that may have never been publicly displayed otherwise\u2014and most certainly, not all together. For visitors, and especially for future Michigan alumni, Victors for Art illuminates the shared passion for art fostered by the Michigan experience.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by Joseph Rosa, Guest Curator, in collaboration with Laura De Becker, Helmut & Candis Stern Associate Curator of African Art, Jennifer Friess, Assistant Curator of Photography, Lehti Mairike Keelman, Assistant Curator of Western Art, and Natsu Oyobe, Curator of Asian Art.\n\nLead support for Victors for the Arts: Michigan's Alumni Collectors is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the University of Michigan Health System, the University of Michigan Office of the President, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs and the National Endowment for the Arts, and the University of Michigan Bicentennial Office.", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1724899501156129/"}, {"date": "2017-03-26T15:00:00-04:00", "name": "In Conversation: Framing the Word of the Buddha", "description": "In Tibetan Buddhism, books are the embodiment of the word of the Buddha, serving as his substitute after his passage into nirvana. They are therefore venerated and handled with the utmost respect. Elaborate book covers were commissioned to honor the Buddha, as well as to accrue good merit on the path to enlightenment. Protecting Wisdom features thirty-three book covers dating from the eleventh to the eighteenth century that represent the glorious iconographic array and non-figural decoration typical of these sacred items. Distinguished scholar of Tibetan Buddhism, Professor Donald Lopez will talk about the function, the meaning, and the artistry of these sacred objects that reflect an intense devotion to the Buddha and his teachings. The program starts in The Multipurpose Room.\n\nLead support for Protecting Wisdom: Tibetan Book Covers from the MacLean Collection is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, Michigan Medicine, and the Herbert W. and Susan L.
