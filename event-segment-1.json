This career-spanning volume conveys the hypnotic spectrum of her full poetic output, from Hosiery Seams on a Bowlegged Woman, her 1983 debut, to Slave Moth, her acclaimed 2006 novel in verse, to more than fifty pages of new poems. Whether in early or recent writing, Moss makes no promises of smooth sailing: even when her poems begin with beloved cultural icons (Robert Frost, Doctor Who, the Statue of Liberty), they insist on new perspectives, truths, and realities. She is a fearless reimaginer of poetry\u2019s possibilities, a writer who seems made for (and by) the digital age\u2014its blitz of interactivity and reinvention\u2014a futuristic archivist always compelled by the current moment.  Arranged chronologically, this volume offers us Moss as she has evolved through the past three decades, recognizable yet unpredictable, ever \u201ca poet of fierce intelligence and radiant intensity\u201d (Mart\u00edn Espada).

She is a writer who speaks bitterness and makes her own music of it.\u201d\u2014Marilyn Hacker, Women\u2019s Review of Books\n\nThylias Moss is a multi-racial Professor Emerita in the departments of English and Art & Design at the University of Michigan. Her eight previous books of poetry include Last Chance for the Tarzan Holler, a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist, and Slave Moth, named Best Poetry Book of 2004 by Black Issues Book Review.

Tickets are $10 and are available by phone at 734-971-2228 or in limited quantities at the door. Due to limited seating, ordering tickets in advance is recommended.\n\nThe Civic Improv Ensemble was founded in April 2015 by directors Shelly Smith and David Widmayer with the goal of building a sustainable improv comedy performance and education program at Ann Arbor Civic Theatre. After two rounds of auditions, over thirty actors were cast in three new performance troupes: CSI: Ann Arbor (directed by Shelly Smith), Luxury Possum (directed by Jen Delisi), and Dearly Beloved (directed by David Widmayer). The troupes each focus on a different style of improv comedy, ranging from game-based improv (ala Whose Line Is It Anyway?) to long-form scenic improv (popularized by iO Chicago and Upright Citizens Brigade). Each of the four shows in the upcoming Fall Showcase will feature completely unique improvised sets inspired by audience suggestions. \n\nIn addition to shows at A2CT, the three troupes have performed at theaters around southeast Michigan, including Barefoot Productions in Plymouth and Pointless Brewery & Theatre in Ann Arbor.", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/236841736733878/", "name": "Fall Improv Showcase"}, {"description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers.\n\nGroup 1: Arthur & Steve\nGroup 2: Listen, Stupid\nGroup 3: The League of Pointless Improvisers", "date": "2016-11-18T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1183590841699842/", "name": "Pointless Improv with Arthur & Steve and Listen, Stupid"}, {"description": "Grammy Award winner Don Henry's songs have been recorded by legends such as Ray Charles, Patti Page and Conway Twitty; by country crooners including Gene Watson, John Conlee and B.J.
