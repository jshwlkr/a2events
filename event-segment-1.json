The Studebaker family, with a tradition of blacksmithing, began building wagons in South Bend, Indiana in 1852, and eventually became the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles. Early in the 20th century they added electric, and then gasoline powered, vehicles (initially produced in Detroit). Studebaker was the only wagon and carriage manufacturer to successfully transition to motor vehicles into the modern era, ending production of automobiles in 1966. Though always outpaced by the Big Three financially, Studebaker often exhibited daring and ground breaking design, especially after World War II. One model, the Avanti, was so well regarded that it continued in production by various independent successor companies into 2006. This display will showcase vehicles dating back to 1880 all the way up to 2002.\n\nAwards judged by Bill Crispin Chevrolet and other Show sponsors presented at 7 pm at the corner of Main and Liberty.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1629489244034490/", "name": "Rolling Sculpture Car Show"}, {"date": "2016-07-08T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Literati is thrilled to launch the latest issue of the Michigan Review of Prisoner Creative Writing, produced by the Prison Creative Arts Project.

She became an expert in seeing the world the way an architect sees it. But as a progressive architectural thinker, Henry\u2019s inspiration has been to deconstruct that vision, to \u201cunsee\u201d the very forms and representations that constitute an architect\u2019s basic language.\n\nThrough speculative experiments and conceptual drawings Henry discovers in static architectural details an unsettling range of figurative expression, including, for example, the way the profiles of roof eaves resemble human heads. Wallpaper, with its ability to mask, transform, or animate a space, is also a prominent element in her work. Her projects explore how these features animate our subjective experience\u2014what she calls our \u201cshifting fantasies\u201d\u2014of architectural space.\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L.
