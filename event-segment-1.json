Brit will be joined in conversation by Chris McCormick, the author of Desert Boys.\n\nSet within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett\u2019s mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret. \u201cAll good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we\u2019d taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.\u201d\n\nIt is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother\u2019s recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor\u2019s son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it\u2019s not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance\u2014and the subsequent cover-up\u2014will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt.\n\nIn entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a \u201cwhat if\u201d can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.\n\n\u201cBrit Bennett\u2019s masterful debut is brimming with unforgettable scenes and the sort of keenly-observed, precise language that makes you look at your own relationships anew. Told with the wisdom of a seasoned, compassionate storyteller, The Mothers is a novel about community, friendship, grief and growth. The two women at the center of this novel are characters you will find yourself thinking about long after you\u2019ve turned the last page\u2013 they pull you in close and never let you go. Bennett is a brilliant and much-needed new voice in literature.\u201d \u2013Angela Flournoy, author of National Book Award-finalist The Turner House\n\n\u201cBrit Bennett\u2019s The Mothers is an engaging and assured debut novel of depth, and introspective power. It succeeds as a brilliant study of a modern black woman, and as a lyrical and majestic portrait of her place in society.\u201d \u2014Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen\n\n\u201cWonderful \u2013 warm and tender and necessary.\u201d \u2013Yaa Gyasi, author of Homegoing \n\nBorn and raised in Southern California, Brit Bennett graduated from Stanford University and later earned her MFA in fiction at the University of Michigan, where she won a Hopwood Award in Graduate Short Fiction as well as the 2014 Hurston/Wright Award for College Writers.
