The album, produced by Warn Defever, sheds light on the way forward for a band that has been forging its own vital sound. This is not the Afrobeat of Fela, nor the revivalist funk of a forgotten decade. This record owes as much to Can, Eno, and MIA as it does Kuti, Francis Bebey, and Funkadelic. On Ghost Rock, NOMO arrives in a new place. There's no loss of steam as they incorporate new influences, instead NOMO breaks through with a matured and developed sound that is fully its own.\n\nWSG: minihorse", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/568255470049274/", "name": "NOMO 1/21/17 at the Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2017-01-21T21:00:00-05:00", "description": "Electric Playground Entertainment Presents:\n\nPlayground Party: 001\n\n9 - 10:15:  PocketMonsta\nSoundcloud.com/pocket_monsta\n\n10:15 - 11:30: Kent Clark\nSoundcloud.com/kentclarkdetroit\n\n11:30 - 12:45:  Trauma Kidd\nSoundcloud.com/trauma-kidd\n\n12:45 - 2:  PAT in the HAT\nSoundcloud.com/patinthehatdoe\n______________________________________________________\n\nVisuals by Mad Mike's Visuals\n______________________________________________________\n\nVending\n\nSculpted Roots by Jessica Considine\n______________________________________________________\n\nPhotography by CUTE but PSYCHO Photography\n______________________________________________________\n\nDoors 9pm\n18+ with valid ID\n21+ to drink\n\nTickets: \n$5 all night over 21\n$7 all night under 21", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1245680672146843/", "name": "Playground Party: 001"}]
