Emerging patterns, thoughts and ideas begin to show themselves in a way that was impossible to see by only looking at one. Things are always in conversation with each other. Their meanings are derived through interactions with other elements and those meanings change as context changes. Artists often employ comparison, context and groupings to create meaning in their work. While there are many different approaches that can be taken, the outcome is the same; to create a larger entity that arises through the interactions among smaller or simpler entities.\n\nIn Emergent Effect, the artists use these methods to create meaning and find meaning in the spaces between all of their work as well. All the artists have their practices located in Ypsi Alloy Studios and in that shared space they also share ideas. Though they all work in different mediums and materials, a common voice can be found.\n\n-----------\nThe 117 Gallery 2016/2017 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC", "date": "2017-01-13T18:00:00-05:00", "name": "Emergent Effect: Opening Reception", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1164636040280941/"}, {"description": "One MFA student of fiction and one of poetry, each introduced by a peer, will read their work.
