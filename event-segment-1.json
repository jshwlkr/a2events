Positive that dimensions were colliding and that he could literally feel the deepest will of some mystic past, he decided not to ignore these voices but to contemplate their input, and thus Interdimensional Transmissions came to fruition and the idea-based project Ectomorph found a true home. Since then the vision has continually grown organically and mutated into something that is hard to describe yet easy to feel. His sets effortlessly combine a multitude of seemingly disparate genres into a coalescing solid sound system sensation - pure transcendent psychedelic wizardry. \n\nAlso Featuring:\n\nUnofficial: Matilda\n\nDoogatron\n\nPAT in the HAT\n\n7$\nLocated @ Club Above (Above the Heidleberg) Ann Arbor, MI.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1654083548217903/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "BMG at The Club Above w/ Matilda // Doogatron // Pat in the Hat", "date": "2017-01-07T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "Kabuki actors were superstars in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan.

This event will take place in the Rackham Amphitheater and is free and open to the public. Join us!\n\nIn a series of personal letters to his sons, Omar Saif Ghobash offers a short and highly readable manifesto that tackles our current global crisis with the training of an experienced diplomat and the personal responsibility of a father. Today's young Muslims will be tomorrow's leaders, and yet too many are vulnerable to extremist propaganda that seems omnipresent in our technological age. The burning question, Ghobash argues, is how moderate Muslims can unite to find a voice that is true to Islam while actively and productively engaging in the modern world. What does it mean to be a good Muslim?\n\nWhat is the concept of a good life? And is it acceptable to stand up and openly condemn those who take the Islamic faith and twist it to suit their own misguided political agendas? In taking a hard look at these seemingly simple questions, Ghobash encourages his sons to face issues others insist are not relevant, not applicable, or may even be Islamophobic. These letters serve as a clear-eyed inspiration for the next generation of Muslims to understand how to be faithful to their religion and still navigate through the complexities of today's world. They also reveal an intimate glimpse into a world many are unfamiliar with and offer to provide an understanding of the everyday struggles Muslims face around the globe.\n\nOmar Saif Ghobash is the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Russia. In addition to his post in Moscow, Ambassador Ghobash sponsors the Saif Ghobash-Banipal Prize for Arabic Literary Translation and founded the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in collaboration with the Booker Prize in London. Ambassador Ghobash studied law at Oxford and mathematics at the University of London.\n\nDavid Serio is an Education and Public Programming Specialist at the Arab American National Museum (AANM).  He holds a M.A. in Near Eastern Studies and Arabic from Wayne State University.  Mr. Serio joined the AANM in January of 2011, initially as an AmeriCorps, later being hired as a full-time Educator and Public Programmer.  As an Educator and Public Programmer, Mr. Serio has conducted educational presentations and workshops throughout the Mid-West.  Mr. Serio also helps in the planning and implementation of youth programs and cultural events.  Mr. Serio is also the Curator of the Arab Film Festival and manages all of the AANM\u2019s film programming, both at the AANM and at offsite locations around the world.  Mr. Serio is also the Volunteer Coordinator and responsible with growing and managing the volunteer program.

In an era defined by mass incarceration, endless war, economic crisis, catastrophic environmental destruction, and a political system offering more of the same, radical social transformation has never been more urgent. Demand the Impossible! urges us to imagine a world beyond what this rotten system would have us believe is possible. In critiquing the world around us, insurgent educator and activist Bill Ayers uncovers cracks in the system, raising our sights for radical change, and envisioning strategies for building a movement to create a more humane, balanced, and peaceful world.\n\n\"For Bill Ayers, it is the freedom of our collective imagination that links the contemporary world\u2014ensconced as it is in pervasive militarism, racist violence, and environmental devastation\u2014to the flourishing of our planet. This is a manifesto that should be read by everyone who wants to believe that \u201canother world is possible.\u201d\u2014Angela Y. Davis, author of Abolition Democracy and Freedom is a Constant Struggle\n\n\"With huge numbers of us recognizing the need for transformative change, this ambitious and exuberant book perfectly matches its historical moment. Ayers fearlessly confronts the intersecting crises of our age\u2014endless war, surging inequality, unchecked white supremacy and perilous planetary warming\u2014while mapping emancipatory new possibilities. From the first page, his courage is contagious.\"\u2014Naomi Klein, author of This Changes Everything and The Shock Doctrine\n\n\"Demand the Impossible is more than a book, more than a manifesto. It is a torch. Bill Ayers\u2019 vision for a humane future is incendiary\u2014fire that incinerates old logics and illuminates new paths. If we do not end the violence of militarism, materialism, caging, dispossession, debt, want, ignorance, and global warming, our very survival is impossible. Read aloud.\"\u2014Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams\n\nBill Ayers is a social justice activist, teacher, Distinguished Professor of Education (retired) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of two memoirs, Fugitive Days and Public Enemy.\n\nEvent date: \nTuesday, January 10, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \n124 E.
