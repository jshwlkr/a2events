Join Ari as he talks about his beliefs on cooking from his new book, \"Zingerman's Guide to Good leading, Part 4: A Lapsed Anarchist's Approach to the Power of Beliefs in Business\". Chef Alex Young has prepared an approachable, uncomplicated menu that will highlight the quality of local, artisan ingredients, including beautiful autumn vegetables from Cornman Farms and his full-flavored pasture-raised beef. One of the beliefs about food that Ari will talk about at the dinner is that every single thing should be delicious on its own, but then develop even more character in combination. \"We define full flavor as complexity, balance and finish, and that's what each ingredient on the menu should bring.\" Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity to learn more about how beliefs can impact your own approach to food and cooking, and to taste the difference with our really good menu.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1810203432597328/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-05T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Derek Palacio", "description": "Literati is thrilled to welcome Derek Palacio in support of his novel, The Mortifications.\n\nDerek Palacio\u2019s stunning, mythic novel marks the arrival of a fresh voice and a new chapter in the history of 21st century Cuban-American literature.\n\nIn 1980, a rural Cuban family is torn apart during the Mariel Boatlift. Uxbal Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2014father, husband, political insurgent\u2014refuses to leave behind the revolutionary ideals and lush tomato farms of his sun-soaked homeland. His wife Soledad takes young Isabel and Ulises hostage and flees with them to America, leaving behind Uxbal for the promise of a better life. But instead of settling with fellow Cuban immigrants in Miami\u2019s familiar heat, Soledad pushes further north into the stark, wintry landscape of Hartford, Connecticut. There, in the long shadow of their estranged patriarch, now just a distant memory, the exiled mother and her children begin a process of growth and transformation.\n\nEach struggles and flourishes in their own way: Isabel, spiritually hungry and desperate for higher purpose, finds herself tethered to death and the dying in uncanny ways. Ulises is bookish and awkwardly tall, like his father, whose memory haunts and shapes the boy\u2019s thoughts and desires. Presiding over them both is Soledad. Once consumed by her love for her husband, she begins a tempestuous new relationship with a Dutch tobacco farmer. But just as the Encarnaci\u00f3ns begin to cultivate their strange new way of life, Cuba calls them back. Uxbal is alive, and waiting.\n\nBreathtaking, soulful, and profound, The Mortifications is an intoxicating family saga and a timely, urgent expression of longing for one\u2019s true homeland.\n\n\u201cA revelatory tale of Cuba and America, of faith and family, of the spirit and the flesh, The Mortifications is a debut remarkable for its wise and scrupulous insight into the human heart. Palacio feelingly reminds us that all immigrants are also exiles, wounded with loss, striving to make a home even as they yearn for the one they\u2019ve left behind.\u201d \u2014Peter Ho Davies\n\n\u201cA novel of stunning sweep and vision. The story of the Encarnaci\u00f3n family plunges the reader into the dislocating heartache of life in exile, in the intermediary land between the home that has been forsaken and the one that might, in the future, await. Derek Palacio\u2019s prose is so assured it\u2019s hard to believe The Mortifications is his first novel\u2014but it is, miraculously, and it is one magnificent debut.\u201d \u2014Laura van den Berg\n\nDerek Palacio received his MFA in Creative Writing from the Ohio State University. His short story \u201cSugarcane\u201d appeared in The O. Henry Prize Stories 2013, and his novella How to Shake the Other Man was published by Nouvella Books. He lives and teaches in Ann Arbor, MI, is the co-director, with Claire Vaye Watkins, of the Mojave School, and serves as a faculty member of the Institute of American Indian Arts MFA program.\n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, October 5, 2016 - 7:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1685511088438901/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-06T09:00:00-04:00", "name": "Maker Space Operations Bootcamp", "description": "Maker Works\u2019 Makerspace Operations Bootcamp puts you in the middle of an established makerspace for a five-day inspiring deep-dive into the tools for running a sustainable makerspace.
