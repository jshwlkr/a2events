A Pittsburgh native, Moore has been a human jukebox in dive bars, a songsmith on festival stages, and a hootenanny revivalist. Eric\u2019s stellar fingerstyle work bumps down the jagged, thorny backroads of the Mississippi delta and skips over the seas to the British Isles. \n\nWhile he was working as a river guide in Grand Teton Nat\u2019l Park, he frequented the  legendary Hootenanny at Dornans in Jackson Hole, WY. The Hoot\u2019s mandate on traditional music was a scourge to many a songwriter, but not so for Moore. He began a spirited inquiry into acoustic guitar styles and the pre-war songbook. Taking cues from players like Bert Jansch, John Martyn, Archie Fisher and the Delta Blues great Tommy Johnson, Moore brings fresh arrangements and decades of performing experience to his spirited originals and traditional music from both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1699294757015373/", "date": "2016-04-19T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Skazat!

Predator versus prey may be a familiar story, but hear it with some new \"micro\" characters.  \n\nAbout Ada: Ada Hagan is a doctoral student at the University of Michigan in the department of Microbiology and Immunology.
