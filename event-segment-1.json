Sweeney in support of his most recent title, The Enthusiast: How the Best Friend of Francis of Assisi Almost Destroyed What He Started.\n\nPopular historian and award-winning author Jon M. Sweeney relates the untold story of St. Francis\u2019s friendship with Elias of Cortona, the man who helped him build the Franciscan movement. Sweeney uses the complexities of their relationship in a gripping narrative of how their efforts changed the world and how Elias\u2019s enthusiasm betrayed the ideals of his friend.\n\nBlending history and biography, Sweeney reveals how Francis and Elias rebuilt churches, aided lepers, and entertained as \u201cGod\u2019s troubadours\u201d to the delight of everyday people who had grown tired of a remote and tumultuous Church. At the height of their spiritual renaissance, however, Elias became \u201cthe devil\u201d to many of the other friars; they believed him to be a traitor to their ideals. After Francis\u2019s premature death, the movement fractured. Scorned by most of the Franciscan leadership, Elias followed a path that would leave him a lonely, broken man. Sweeney shows how Elias\u2019s undoing was rooted in his attempts to honor his old friend.\n\nJon M. Sweeney is an independent scholar and one of religion\u2019s most respected writers. His work has been hailed by everyone from PBS and James Martin, S.J., to Fox News and Dan Savage. He\u2019s been interviewed on CBS Saturday Morning, Fox News, CBS-TV Chicago, Religion and Ethics Newsweekly, and on the popular program Chicago Tonight. Several of his books have become Book-of-the-Month Club and Quality Paperback Book Club selections. His popular medieval history, The Pope Who Quit, was published by Image/Random House and optioned by HBO. It was a selection of the History Book Club and received a starred review in Booklist. His book, When Saint Francis Saved the Church, received a 2015 award for excellence in history from the Catholic Press Association. His other words include Inventing Hell, The Complete Francis of Assisi, and The St. Francis Prayer Book. Sweeney writes regularly for America and The Tablet, and is also the editorial director at Franciscan Media. He is married, the father of three, and lives in Vermont.\nEvent date: \nWednesday, June 1, 2016 - 7:00pm", "name": "Jon M.
