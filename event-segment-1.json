June 25 | 9:30pm | 18+ | $10 Cover\n\nSuper Happy Funtime Burlesque is a 12 member touring monstrosity. A live band, a burlesque troupe, a circus act, that is all together too contemporary, too modern, too bawdy, and too controversial to be defined just as \u201cburlesque\u201d. So, calling itself \u2018burlesque\u2019 for lack of a better term, SHFB is heading out for their 7th national tour this fall with its newest musical production. Designed to find your line and cross it, some kind of strange mix of GWAR and Benny Goodman with touches of SNL and the Price is Right, SHFB sprays you with glitter and love while playfully degrading taboo subjects like religion, politics, and sex. \u201cFor every 100 people dancing, there are usually ten or so walking out the door,\u201d says host and bandleader Mr. Happypants, \u201cYou either get it or you don\u2019t; the right people get it.\u201d SHFB sets itself apart from other burlesque shows, and touring acts in general, for one major reason: its live band playing original music. Somewhere in a middle ground between Frank Zappa and Tom Waits, this show that gets curiosity seekers out with the promise of tits keeps them in the seats with a set of original tunes that get stuck in your head for weeks after the performance. \u201cPeople are surprised by the songwriting! What they don\u2019t know is that we\u2019re all professional artists who\u2019s day jobs are in the musical theater world, we bring that aesthetic and blend it with an underground edginess that leaves peoples jaws on the floor.\u201d SHFB is presenting a new and contemporary musical theater at its finest. Come see it now before it gets so big that you can\u2019t afford the ticket!!", "name": "Super Happy Funtime Burlesque 6/25/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/251628825201774/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-25T23:15:00-04:00", "description": "Children ages four to seven are invited to hear a story in the galleries.

His style drew upon numerous international influences including, among others, Modernism andSurrealism. Although not strictly Surrealist, many of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s works manifest a similarly fantastical mood. One of the artist\u2019s most arresting qualities is his ability to imbue scenes of everyday life with an otherworldly, metaphysical power. The photographs in the exhibition, from UMMA\u2019s collections, show the artist using motifs drawn from Mexican\nreligious and indigenous works as well as plant forms, in a Modernist approach to image making. UMMA docents will discuss these motifs and the artist\u2019s use of light as a metaphor and revealer of life, animating even the emptiest and most silent of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s scenes.\n\nPublic exhibition tours are generously supported by the Richard and Rosann Noel Fund for Museum Education.", "name": "Guided Tour - Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo: Mexico's Poet of Light", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1706443009629359/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-26T14:00:00-04:00", "description": "HELLAWELL...Driftwood on Sand\nFriction Quartet\n\nSHOSTAKOVICH...Sonata for Cello and Piano in D minor, Op. 40\nPaul Watkins, cello; Alessio Bax, piano\n\nBOLCOM...Three Rags for String Quartet\nAltius Quartet\n\nArensky | Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor, Op. 32\nTrio Honor\u00e9\n\nTickets: Please contact Kerrytown Concert House at 734-769-2999 or visit their website for more information.", "name": "GLCMF at Kerrytown Concert House", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/126949477712284/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-26T15:00:00-04:00", "description": "Photographed in nearby Detroit, Catie Newell\u2019s new images from her series Nightly frame scenes of the urban landscape illuminated at night.
