Davis in support of his most recent book, The Vanishing American Corporation: Navigating the Hazards of a New Economy.\n\nIt may be hard to believe in an era of Walmart, Citizens United, and the Koch brothers, but corporations are on the decline. The number of American companies listed on the stock market dropped by half between 1996 and 2012. In recent years we've seen some of the most storied corporations go bankrupt (General Motors, Chrysler, Eastman Kodak) or disappear entirely (Bethlehem Steel, Lehman Brothers, Borders). Gerald Davis argues this is a root cause of the income inequality and social instability we face today. Corporations were once an integral part of building the middle class. He points out that in their heyday they offered millions of people lifetime employment, a stable career path, health insurance, and retirement pensions. They were like small private welfare states. The businesses that are replacing them will not fill the same role. For one thing, they employ far fewer people\u2014the combined global workforces of Facebook, Yelp, Zynga, LinkedIn, Zillow, Tableau, Zulily, and Box are smaller than the number of people who lost their jobs when Circuit City was liquidated in 2009. And in the \u201csharing economy,\u201d companies have no obligation to most of the people who work for them\u2014at the end of 2014 Uber had over 160,000 \u201cdriver-partners\u201d in the United States but recognized only about 2,000 people as actual employees. Davis tracks the rise of the large American corporation and the economic, social, and technological developments that have led to its decline. The future could see either increasing economic polarization, as careers turn into jobs and jobs turn into tasks, or a more democratic economy built from the grass roots. It's up to us.\n\nGerald F. Davis is the Wilbur K. Pierpont Collegiate Professor of Management at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. He has published widely in management, sociology, and finance. Recent books include Social Movements and Organization Theory (with Doug McAdam, W. Richard Scott, and Mayer N. Zald); Organizations and Organizing (with W. Richard Scott); Managed by the Markets (which won the 2010 Terry Award for best book from the Academy of Management); and Changing your Company from the Inside Out (with Christoper White). He is Editor of Administrative Science Quarterly and Director of the Interdisciplinary Committee on Organization Studies (ICOS) at the University of Michigan.", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Gerald F.

When her fantasy inevitably clashes with reality, Margo falls into a deep depression requiring admission to a psychiatric unit.

Miller, an assistant professor at UM's School of Social Work; and Ronald Simpson-Bey, Alumni Associate for Just Leadership USA.\n\nElizabeth Hinton is Assistant Professor of History and African and African American Studies at Harvard University. Hinton\u2019s research focuses on the persistence of poverty and racial inequality in the 20th century United States. In her new book, From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America (Harvard University Press), Hinton examines the implementation of federal law enforcement programs beginning in the mid-1960s that laid the groundwork for the mass incarceration of American citizens. In revealing the links between the rise of the American carceral state and earlier anti-poverty programs, Hinton presents Ronald Reagan\u2019s War on Drugs not as a sharp policy departure but rather as the full realization of a shift towards surveillance and confinement that began during the Johnson administration. Before joining the Harvard faculty, Hinton spent two years as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Michigan Society of Fellows and Assistant Professor in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan. A Ford Foundation Fellow, Hinton completed her Ph.D. in United States History from Columbia University in 2012.\n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, May 25, 2016 - 7:00pm", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Elizabeth Hinton", "date": "2016-05-25T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/228993060811676/", "description": "-$2 wells and $1 shooters before 11pm\n--$2 Bud Light bottles\n--$3 Shock Top pints\n--$3 Malibu Black shots and mixed drinks\n--$5 Soft Parade pints\n\n\n\n\nWildoutWednsdays is here for one thing- to help you get thru that midweek slump!
