In this special event, Gil Shaham collaborates with video artist David Michalek to open up new avenues for listening to and interpreting Bach\u2019s towering masterpieces.\n\nVideo artist David Michalek, best known for his \u201cSlow Dancing\u201d installation at Lincoln Center, and in the capitals of Europe, says of the Bach Six Solos project: \u201cAs a contemporary artist with a particular interest in motion pictures and time, I\u2019ve been compelled to consider how the addition of extreme slow motion might be applied to moving images of the face, the body, obliquely narrative tableaux, and also still life in ways that can both enhance and alter the meanings latent within them. As a visual strategy, extreme slowness creates a continuing sense of a pause in the action \u2014 as if the growth and evolution of the slow-moving image is itself a further manifestation of the deep and consuming absorptive state that often arises while observing it.\u201d\n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/gil-shaham/", "name": "Bach Six Solos: Gil Shaham, violin", "date": "2016-03-26T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/155237174863547/", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers.\n\nGroup 1: \"Get in the Barrel\" starring Lisa Seymour, Tia Peruzzi, Brody Webster, and Sheevani Desai Ignasinski\n\nGroup 2: \"Human Amusements\" starring PJ Jacokes, Jen Hansen, Chris Petersen, Joe Hingelberg, Matt Naas, Travis Pelto, and Amber Hunt\t\n\nGroup 3: \"The League of Pointless Improvisers\" starring Aaron Johnstone, James Quesada, Corene Ford, Erik Heilner, and Julia Schroeder", "name": "Pointless Improv with Get in the Barrel and Human Amusements", "date": "2016-03-26T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1059630090724670/", "description": "Sat.
