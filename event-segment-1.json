Dan will be joined for a post-reading conversation by UM MFA first year in fiction Sam Krowchenko.\n\nTwo sensational unsolved crimes\u2014one in the past, another in the present\u2014are linked by one man\u2019s memory and self-deception in this chilling novel of literary suspense from National Book Award finalist Dan Chaon. \u201cWe are always telling a story to ourselves, about ourselves.\u201d This is one of the little mantras Dustin Tillman likes to share with his patients, and it\u2019s meant to be reassuring. But what if that story is a lie? A psychologist in suburban Cleveland, Dustin is drifting through his forties when he hears the news: His adopted brother, Rusty, is being released from prison. Thirty years ago, Rusty received a life sentence for the massacre of Dustin\u2019s parents, aunt, and uncle. The trial came to epitomize the 1980s hysteria over Satanic cults; despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury believed the outlandish accusations Dustin and his cousin made against Rusty. Now, after DNA analysis has overturned the conviction, Dustin braces for a reckoning.\n\nMeanwhile, one of Dustin\u2019s patients has been plying him with stories of the drowning deaths of a string of drunk college boys. At first Dustin dismisses his patient\u2019s suggestions that a serial killer is at work as paranoid thinking, but as the two embark on an amateur investigation, Dustin starts to believe that there\u2019s more to the deaths than coincidence. Soon he becomes obsessed, crossing all professional boundaries\u2014and putting his own family in harm\u2019s way. From one of today\u2019s most renowned practitioners of literary suspense, Ill Will is an intimate thriller about the failures of memory and the perils of self-deception. In Dan Chaon\u2019s nimble, chilling prose, the past looms over the present, turning each into a haunted place.\n\n\u201cDan Chaon\u2019s new novel is subtly, steadily unnerving\u2014like a scalpel slipping under your skin and prying it, ever so slowly, from the muscle beneath. Ill Will is a dark M\u00f6bius strip of a thriller that will leave you questioning what\u2019s perceived and what\u2019s imagined, and whether the reverberations of tragedy ever truly come to an end.\u201d\u2014Celeste Ng, author of Everything I Never Told You\n\nDan Chaon is the acclaimed author of Among the Missing, which was a finalist for the National Book Award, and You Remind Me of Me, which was named one of the best books of the year by The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, The Christian Science Monitor, and Entertainment Weekly, among other publications. Chaon\u2019s fiction has appeared in many journals and anthologies, including The Best American Short Stories, Pushcart Prize, and The O. Henry Prize Stories. He has been a finalist for the National Magazine Award in Fiction, and he was the recipient of the 2006 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Chaon lives in Cleveland, Ohio, and teaches at Oberlin College, where he is the Pauline M. Delaney Professor of Creative Writing.\n \n\nEvent date: \nThursday, March 16, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

Using technology and a technique, described by Dr. Didg, as live phrase sampling or looping, I am able to entertain myself for two sets. Nothing is prerecorded and all sounds and beats are created live by layering loops on top of one another and then singing or soloing over top if all if it.\n\nSee what I mean? Only being there can explain it.  The thousands of hours on YouTube cannot describe the feeling and vibe of one of my solo shows\u2026..at least the feeling that I get.
