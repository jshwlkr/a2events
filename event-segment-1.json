We are all composers and graduates of the music composition department at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Music, Theatre and Dance. As artists working and writing in the new music scene, we share an affinity for exploring sounds beyond traditional music\u2019s normal aesthetic. While firmly grounded in tradition and cultural context, we also believe that traditions evolve and shape themselves to the present. And while our collaboration as Ensoleil is suffused with this creative energy, it is also driven by our love of the sounds and stories of traditional music, and the multiple lenses our diverse roots offer in approaching tradition.\n\nensoleilband.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1016127498434442/", "name": "Ensoleil // Kerrytown Concert House & LiveStream", "date": "2016-07-05T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "description": "What better way to close out the 4th of July holiday than with a Food Truck Rally?!

Upon its release in May 2015, \u201cFull Circle\u201d was supported by a national tour, along with radio airplay in 11,000 retail stores, commercial radio airplay in 5 midwest states, and airplay on 200+ college radio stations.\nDollar says, \u201cWhen I listen to the latest batch of The Outer Vibe productions, I feel like I'm on a vacation I don't want to leave. The guitars feel like a Cheshire smile on a sunny beach, the drums beat like perfect waves on the shore. Everything stays glued together with sticky-sweet vocals, trumpets sounding from the west, and bass sounds that walked down from another planet.
