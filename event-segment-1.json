Why is it that we read? Is it to pass time? To learn something new? To escape from reality? For Will Schwalbe, reading is a way to entertain himself but also to make sense of the world, to become a better person, and to find the answers to the big (and small) questions about how to live his life. In this delightful celebration of reading, Schwalbe invites us along on his quest for books that speak to the specific challenges of living in our modern world, with all its noise and distractions. In each chapter, he discusses a particular book\u2014what brought him to it (or vice versa), the people in his life he associates with it, and how it became a part of his understanding of himself in the world.  These books span centuries and genres (from classic works of adult and children\u2019s literature to contemporary thrillers and even cookbooks), and each one relates to the questions and concerns we all share. Throughout, Schwalbe focuses on the way certain books can help us honor those we\u2019ve loved and lost, and also figure out how to live each day more fully. Rich with stories and recommendations, Books for Living is a treasure for everyone who loves books and loves to hear the answer to the question: \u201cWhat are you reading?\"\n\n\u201cBooks for Living by Will Schwalbe lives wonderfully up to its title. He offers an easy tone, sections chapter by chapter of his chosen stories and their affiliations to our own lives. He reminds me of a diviner who walks the open fields, taps, and reveals something rarely talked about, or perhaps never noticed, in one story or another, but is important. That\u2019s a thrill! I can\u2019t imagine a person who loves books not being grateful. Any season of the year, this book is a gift.\u201d \u2014Mary Oliver\n\nWill Schwalbe has worked in publishing (he\u2019s now EVP, Editorial Development and Content Innovation for Macmillan); digital media, as the founder and CEO of Cookstr.com; and as a journalist, writing for various publications, including The New York Times and the South China Morning Post. He is on the board of the Kingsborough Community College Foundation. He is the author of The End of Your Life Book Club, and coauthor, with David Shipley, of Send: Why People Email So Badly and How to Do It Better.\n \n\nEvent date: \nThursday, March 9, 2017 - 7:00pm", "name": "Will Schwalbe", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/2126330127593241/"}, {"date": "2017-03-09T19:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "This month we are hosting a full hour of open mic in a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere.

After years of caring for her ungrateful mother, Maureen has little hope of happiness or escape, especially after Mag ruins her first, and perhaps only, chance of a loving relationship.

Additional information is available by visiting www.a2ct.org. \n \nAlmost, Maine is a town so far north, it\u2019s almost in Canada, almost not in the United States, it\u2019s just \u2026 Almost. On a cold, clear night in this remotest of towns, witness nine stories of residents falling in and out of love in the strangest of ways. Set against the hovering northern lights, hearts get broken, knees get bruised, and love is lost, found, and confounded. It\u2019s love. But not quite.\n \nThe subject of this critically acclaimed play is something that veteran director Kat Walsh sees as universal to audiences, and her direction aims to make that connection. \u201cMeaningful relationships require vulnerability --- it means allowing yourself to be fully seen and heard by another person and risking rejection. John Cariani brilliantly captures these inspiring, and yes frightening, moments in his play, Almost, Maine,\" shared director Walsh. \"Our actors and production staff have the heroic task of portraying these acts of courage on stage for an audience.
