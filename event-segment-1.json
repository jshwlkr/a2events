Professor Philip J. Deloria is this installment's featured guest.\n\nSweetland's Word Squared: Writer to Writer series lets you hear directly from University of Michigan professors about their challenges, processes, and expectations as writers and also as readers of student writing. Each semester,Word\u00b2 pairs one esteemed University professor with a Sweetland faculty member for a conversation about writing.\n\nWord\u00b2 sessions are broadcast live on WCBN radio. These conversations offer students a rare glimpse into the writing that professors do outside the classroom. You can hear instructors from various disciplines describe how they handle the same challenges student writers face, from finding a thesis to managing deadlines. Professors will also discuss what they want from student writers in their courses, and will take questions put forth by students and by other members of the University community. If there's anything you've ever wanted to ask a professor about writing, Word\u00b2 gives you the chance.\n\nProfessor Deloria is the Carroll Smith-Rosenberg Collegiate Professor of American Culture and History, former LSA Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education, and past Director of the Program in American Culture and the AC Native American Studies program. He has served as president of the American Studies Association, a council member of the Organization of American Historians, and a Trustee of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. He holds a joint appointment in the Department of American Culture and the Department of History.\n\nEvent date: \nTuesday, November 15, 2016 - 6:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1482747538408633/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-11-15T18:00:00-05:00", "name": "Sweetland Writer to Writer: Philip J Deloria"}, {"description": "We know.
