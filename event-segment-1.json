Economically, politically and culturally, because it was the pursuit of pepper that led Columbus to sail west across the Atlantic. Culinarily because the Columbian Exchange that followed brought tomatoes, potatoes, corn and cacao to the Eastern Hemisphere; cows, goats, and pigs among others went west. And, probably above all, because very few of us sit down to eat a meal that hasn\u2019t been spiced with peppercorns in one way or another.\n\nFor this special meal we\u2019ve put together the culinary talents of Roadhouse Chef Alex Young and Philippe de Vienne, master pepper trader for over thirty years. Together they\u2019ve put together a menu that features some of THE finest peppercorns the world has to offer, all right here at the Roadhouse in form of one delicious meal, all personally selected the de Vienne family who have rightly earned their moniker of Spice Traders by traveling the globe and searching for the most remarkable spices anywhere.\n\nMise en Bouche:\nGrilled Issan Chicken wings\nwith green pepper and garlic, hot sweet and sour dip\n\nAppetizer:\nIsekaya-Style Fish Tartare\nwith sancho pepper, nori and toasted sesame\n\nEntree Choices:\nBraised Cornman Farms\u2019 Pork\nwith figs, almonds and sweet and sour Long pepper sauce\nOR\nSlow Roasted Goat\nwith cubebs, white pepper and lemon grass shallot sauce\n\nDessert:\nChocolate Voatsiperifery Pot de Cr\u00eame", "name": "In Pursuit of Pepper"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1686417714974855/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-12T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n-          April 12 - NEW DATE\u2013 Nick Zomparelli \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pingpongtheband\nhttps://www.facebook.com/daughtersofeternity/\nMulti-instrumentalist Nick Zomparelli (Ping Pong, Daughters of Eternity) performs an eclectic blend of originals and covers with a vibe so nice.\n\n-          April 19 - TBA\n\n-         April 26 - Heather Schwartz\nhttp://www.heatherschwartzmusic.com/\nHeather Schwartz has become known for creating a unique concert experience, with a vintage charm and passionate vocals she truely connects with her audience.
