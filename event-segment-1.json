His poetry is represented in major anthologies including The Oxford India Anthology of Poetry and The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Indian Poetry. He has authored several poetry collections including his latest, Final Cut, along with a memoir, The Ocean in My Yard (Penguin, 2005). \n\nSigning to follow.\n\nThe event begins with an Open Mic session when area poets can read their own work or share a favorite poem by another author in a welcoming atmosphere. This event is part of a poetry series held on the second Thursday of most months at 7pm.\n\n(NOTE: There will not be an Open Mic event in January 2017. )\n\nSaleem Peeradina is one of the most important Indian poets writing in the English language. In Final Cut, his fifth collection, the poet\u2019s focus is turned towards the beauty that lies below the surface of the everyday; the extraordinary hiding in the ordinary.\n\nThese poems are hymns of praise \u2013 to birds, to objects, to fruits and to our own human bodies, intently recounting the character and history of each. In time, items as mundane as a sparrow, a stapler or an orange take on the appearance of wondrous gifts.\n\nThese meditations are joined by monologues, the remarkable yet unremarkable stories of characters encountered by the poet in India, Michigan and beyond. This is the work of a master of language; a self-proclaimed \u2018participant-observer\u2019, set to delight a new generation of poetry readers with this enthralling collection.", "name": "Open Mic & Share Poetry Series feat Saleem Peeradina", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/145978892541912/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-08T22:00:00-05:00", "description": "Come take it back to the 90s with ABSWS!!!
