Ann Street):\nSunday, August 7 at 4:00 PM\nMonday, August 8 at 7:00 PM\n\nCallbacks @ 7:00 PM on Wednesday, 8/10, location TBA.\n\nText work will begin Wednesday, August 24, and rehearsals start Sunday, September 4. Production dates are October 27-30 at the Arthur Miller Theatre on U-M\u2019s North Campus.\n\nAnn Arbor Civic Theatre is seeking ten to fifteen diverse actors for a production of Othello. With the original Shakespearean language intact, this production will be set at a lavish hotel in Saigon during the height of the Vietnam War. A new cut of the script by director David Widmayer emphasizes the role of war abroad and dramatic social change at home in shaping the characters\u2019 attitudes and actions. No stage combat experience is necessary - actors will all have the opportunity to work with Melissa Freilich, a stage combat professional.\n\nActors must be age 16 or older to audition. Many roles will be available to actors of any gender identity. We hope that the cast will represent the growing diversity of the desegregated armed forces in the Vietnam War era, and strongly encourage actors of all ethnic backgrounds to audition. Auditioners may prepare a short (1-2 minute) Shakespearean monologue of their choice, or receive a monologue at auditions for a cold reading. At the audition, it is most important that actors demonstrate their ability to clearly convey the story - not just using the text, but using their body and range of emotional expression as well.\n\nPlease email the director with any questions, including requests for an alternate audition time. djwidmayer@gmail.com", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-08-08T16:00:00-04:00", "name": "Othello Auditions"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1542034336104534/", "description": "Are you interested in learning more about how to care for our natural areas?

What we believe may or may not be true, but unknowingly most of us will behave in ways that reinforce our beliefs anyways. At this breakfast, Ari Weinzweig, Co-Founder and CEO of Zingerman\u2019s Community of Businesses, will take a look at how the impact of those beliefs likely play out in our day to day experiences in the workplace, and how we and our workplaces are impacted by those beliefs. Whether we accept it or not, what we believe about ourselves, about our organization, our co-workers, our boss, the work that we do and our ability to do it will significantly alter the outcomes we are seeking to achieve. And how, by becoming more mindful of our beliefs, we can effectively backtrack\u2014by altering our beliefs, we change the way we see our work and the world and then, in turn, significantly alter the outcomes we get from our efforts.\n\nIt is our belief you will leave breakfast with a full stomach and a full mind - with new insights, tips and techniques into how you can become more mindful of your own beliefs and how you can positively affect your surroundings by changing your beliefs.\n\nBreakfast is served!\n- Fresh Fruit Platter\n- Zingerman\u2019s Bakehouse Coffee Cakes\n- Corned Beef Hash\n- Applewood Smoked Bacon\n- Zingerman\u2019s Coffee Co.
