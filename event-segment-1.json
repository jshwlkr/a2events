Even as her compressed stories are unfolding on a suburban cul de sac, they are deep in the mythical woods, \u201cwhere children, despite their commonness, / are a delicacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaggie Smith\u2019s collection is magical and troubling.\u2026 Time alternates between the forest where there are refrigerator magnets and safety belts, and The Forest where you, a now-human you, once preened \u2018your blue-black wings.\u2019\u2026 Time stops for violence and passion. Be intrigued. Find yourself welcome.\u201d \u2014 Kimiko Hahn\n\n\u201cSome kind of primary mythic world lies behind and throughout these adult tales of ultimate matters.\u2026 as much about the terrible and beautiful dreams of children as it is about waking up as a parent. This is a rare book of poems.\u201d \u2014 Stanley Plumly\n\n\u201cEnchantment: that rarest of all poetic gifts. As when the neurons, in the kaleidoscopic movie they call a \u201cfunctional MRI,\u201d speak to us in colors on a screen from the deepest recesses of what we already know. Maggie Smith\u2019s are poems of transformation: haunting, gorgeous, intimately unsettling. I cannot remember when I last read a book to match her powers of delight.\u201d \u2014 Linda Gregerson\n\n\u201cFolk tales and their eerie, animistic wisdom are a wellspring for these powerful lyrics. The poems are ethereal and dark, brimming with dread, beauty, and rapture. The Bloody Chamber, Angela Carter\u2019s arresting prose engagement with fairy tales, comes to mind. Smith updates motifs of the pacts children make with nature, the power of luck and curses, loss of innocence, the vulnerable and the sinister, primal fears of being eaten, and much more. The images are so fresh and inventive they shimmer. Original, cautionary, rich, delicious, The Well Speaks\u2026is a spellbinding collection.\u201d \u2014 Amy Gerstler\n\nMaggie Smith holds a BA from Ohio Wesleyan University and an MFA from The Ohio State University. Her previous books are Lamp of the Body (Red Hen Press, 2005) and three prizewinning chapbooks, Disasterology (Dream Horse Press, forthcoming), The List of Dangers (Kent State/Wick Poetry Series, 2010), and Nesting Dolls (Pudding House, 2005).

Maggie is overjoyed to have that solitude to make her Salad Pie. But then Herbert saunters over and wants to play too. \"I'm making salad. Salad Pie. And don't you touch it!\" Herbert just wants to help, even though Maggie makes it clear she won't let him. Then her imaginary pie takes a spill, and she realizes Herbert's intentions are not so bad after all.\n\nWendy BooydeGraaff grew up making mud pies on a fruit farm in Ontario, Canada. She now lives in Michigan with her family, where she whips up all kinds of salads and all kinds of pies.\n\nEvent date: \nSaturday, May 7, 2016 - 11:00am", "name": "Story Time with Wendy Booydegraff"}]
