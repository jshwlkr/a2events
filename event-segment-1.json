This two-part exhibition (Part I: Figuration followed by Part II: Abstraction on view July 1\u2013 October 29) presents works collected by a diverse group of alumni that represent the breadth of the University and over seventy years of graduating classes. The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vige\u0301e Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d. It also offers an unprecedented opportunity to view art that may have never been publicly displayed otherwise\u2014and most certainly, not all together. For visitors, and especially for future Michigan alumni, Victors for Art illuminates the shared passion for art fostered by the Michigan experience.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by Joseph Rosa, Guest Curator, in collaboration with Laura De Becker, Helmut & Candis Stern Associate Curator of African Art, Jennifer Friess, Assistant Curator of Photography, Lehti Mairike Keelman, Assistant Curator of Western Art, and Natsu Oyobe, Curator of Asian Art.\n\nLead support for Victors for the Arts: Michigan's Alumni Collectors is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the University of Michigan Health System, the University of Michigan Office of the President, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs and the National Endowment for the Arts, and the University of Michigan Bicentennial Office.", "name": "Victors for Art: Michigan's Alumni Collectors\u2013Part I: Figuration"}, {"date": "2017-03-05T15:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1737031363276684/", "description": "Join us for a long-awaited small-batch beer release! This one is from our Brewmaster himself, Oliver Roberts. There is a very limited amount of Creamy Good available, so clear your Sunday afternoon! Plus: We're featuring brisket tacos with mole sauce to pair with this chocolatey treat. Read on for a description! \n\nFrom Oliver: \"Tantalizing aromas of maple syrup and sweet dipping chocolate preface a silky, smooth, creamy first sip with hints of dark chocolate followed by campfire toasted marshmallows. Creamy Good has been aging quietly in the corner of the brewery cellar for over a year. It was Brewmaster Oliver Roberts' first 10 gallon brew in years, alas when it was done fermenting he pushed it aside to age and forgot about it. He walked past it hundreds of times somehow knowing it wasn't ready. Then the bartenders of Wolverine State could wait no more and got it ready to serve. Should beer ever be aged or forgotten for a year? Not typically but in this case it is so Creamy Good.\"\n\n6.7% ABV/34 IBUs", "name": "Small-Batch Beer Release: Creamy Good!"}]
