And now we're in The Madhouse! Not only are we back, but we'll be there every Sunday night.\n\nPlease refrain from bringing alcohol. Beer and wine will be available for purchase. You will need to buy a membership to drink, $2 for the day, or $10 for the whole year. Layout will be basically what we had before in Ypsi, boxes and cans with a container for money. \nOK, so here's the spiel:\n\n\nWatch old comics develop new bits and new comics just develop at the UNclub (TM) at The Madhouse in Ypsilanti, MI.\n\nFor non-performers, a $5 suggested donation at the door to cover overhead.\n\nComics and performers, please follow these procedures for stage time:\n\n- Click \"Going\" on this Facebook Event. Even if you are thinking about it, you can click \"Interested\" so you can get updates on this page. Do this by 4:00pm, the day of the show. This does not guarantee you a spot, but not doing it puts you at the bottom of the list.\n\n- After 4:00pm Sunday, \"show ups\" can \"go up\" only if spots are available.\n- The line-up will be created just before showtime.\n- Those arriving after the line-up is finalized will be given spots as time permits.\n- Length of stage time will depend largely on the turn out, performer's experience, and the show-runner's discretion.\n- As always, if you show up and do not get a spot, you will be put at the top of the list for the next show.\n\n--- Want to increase your odds of getting a spot? Here's some DO's and DON'T's\nDO . . . . Share this event page with your fans on your fan page, your facebook page, your website, or your tweets, or any other social media.\nDO . . . . Volunteer for less time. If you are willing to do 3 rather than 5, or 4 rather than 7, then you are more likely to get a spot.\nDO . . . . Come to the paid shows.\nDO . . . . Stay for \"meet and greet\" after shows.\nDO . . . . Answer poll questions whenever they appear on the event page.\nDO . . . . Bring people. This is not, I repeat NOT, a \"bringer.\" But if somebody has come to see you, it will be very hard to deny you a spot. In the past, we've had shows where we've added a minute of time for every person the comic brought as a non-performing audience member. Bring three people and a five minute spot becomes an eight minute spot.\n\nContact Mark at: www.facebook.com/marksweetman\n\nChili Challis, former staff writer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and nationally known comedian, writer and teacher says about The UNclub,\n\n\"The ... UNclub IS as close to a pure artist's way of pursuing, grasping and understanding comedy as I have ever known; not to mention it's open and fair to every talent, EVERY talent, even ones right off the street. Comics are allowed to go 'out there' and they're permitted to fail and still be welcomed back. It doesn't get any better than that as far as I'm concerned, and I've been known to be a bit fussy. This special venue is poised for the big wave, it is so ready and worthy of being discovered by an audience...and when they do it will be pure addiction.\"\ufeff", "date": "2016-09-11T20:30:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/289346698113111/", "name": "The UNclub at the Madhouse, September 11, 2016", "source": "Facebook"}, {"description": "Books and brews are a-go!
