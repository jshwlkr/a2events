The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality. When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to \u201ccure\u201d him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness. By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, this memoir is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.\n\n\u201cBoy Erased is an essential document of the early 21st Century. Conley bears witness to something history will eventually condemn as too horrible to have happened, but he also takes the pain of \u2018ex-gay therapy\u2019 and makes of it not just a record but a wonder.\u201d\u2014Alexander Chee, author of The Queen of the Night\n\n\u201cThis brave and bracing memoir is an urgent reminder that America remains a place where queer people have to fight for their lives. It\u2019s also a generous portrait of a family in which the myths of prejudice give way before the reality of love. Equal parts sympathy and rage, Boy Erased is a necessary, beautiful book.\u201d \u2014Garth Greenwell, author of What Belongs to You\n\n\u201cGarrard Conley's memoir about the author\u2019s time in the ex-gay movement is actually about surviving an attempt at soul-murder. The author has given us a clear and beautifully written account of what he went through. This is a book that had to be written, and it deserves a wide audience.\u201d\u2014Charles Baxter, author of The Feast of Love\n\n\u201cIn 1982, Edmund White broke literary ground with his memoir A Boy\u2019s Own Story. Now it\u2019s Garrard Conley\u2019s turn to bring his own story to readers. Conley is brave and honest in his depiction of growing up gay in conservative Christian America. As White was three decades ago for his generation, Conley is an important and necessary contemporary voice.\u201d\u2014Ann Hood, author of The Knitting Circle and Comfort\n\n\u201cA brave account of a young many coming to terms with his sexuality in an environment that reviles him for it. A triumphant, heart-felt story.\u201d \u2014Julia Scheeres, author of Jesus Land\n\nGarrard Conley\u2019s fiction and nonfiction can be found in The Common, The Madison Review, Spork, and elsewhere. He was a finalist for Narrative Magazine\u2019s Winter 2013 story contest.

From the very beginning, they felt this place should be more than just a hangout; that is could be a safe place to make new friends, mix with youth from different backgrounds, explore new ideas, learn new skills and do it all in a setting that was teen friendly and teen driven. Teens wrote the mission statement and the first grant proposal to the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation and, with seed money in hand, enlisted parents and friends to turn an old brick and timber warehouse into a teen center.", "name": "The Neutral Zone Presents: Open Mic Night"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-13T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/494032960807144/", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers.\n\nGroup 1: \"MATCH\" starring Matt Pendrige and Mitch Socia \n\nGroup 2: \"Adultery\" starring Aaron Johnstone, Nuverre Naami, Lorin Kozlowski\n\nGroup 3: \"The League of Pointless Improvisers\" starring Aaron Johnstone, Corene Ford, Moni Jones, Maggie O'Reilly, Mitch Socia", "name": "Pointless Improv with MATCH and Adultery"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-13T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1637106023218709/", "description": "\"Harmony Bones\" is a quintet of long-time veterans of the Ann Arbor folk music scene.
