This two-part exhibition (Part I: Figuration followed by Part II: Abstraction on view July 1\u2013 October 29) presents works collected by a diverse group of alumni that represent the breadth of the University and over seventy years of graduating classes. The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vige\u0301e Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d. It also offers an unprecedented opportunity to view art that may have never been publicly displayed otherwise\u2014and most certainly, not all together. For visitors, and especially for future Michigan alumni, Victors for Art illuminates the shared passion for art fostered by the Michigan experience.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by Joseph Rosa, Guest Curator, in collaboration with Laura De Becker, Helmut & Candis Stern Associate Curator of African Art, Jennifer Friess, Assistant Curator of Photography, Lehti Mairike Keelman, Assistant Curator of Western Art, and Natsu Oyobe, Curator of Asian Art.\n\nLead support for Victors for the Arts: Michigan's Alumni Collectors is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the University of Michigan Health System, the University of Michigan Office of the President, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs and the National Endowment for the Arts, and the University of Michigan Bicentennial Office.", "name": "Victors for Art: Michigan's Alumni Collectors\u2013Part I: Figuration"}, {"date": "2017-02-18T11:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/245767159212723/", "description": "Children ages four to seven are invited to hear a story in the galleries.
