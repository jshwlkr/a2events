Katie\u2019s 2010 CD release, We Are Each Other\u2019s Angels, has received extensive airplay across the country and around the world. When not doing her own gigs, Katie has been known to \u201cmoonlight\u201d singing harmony for folk-rock legend Melanie and local favorite Matt Watroba.\n\nVocal trio All About Eve (Katie, Deb Wood, David Vaughn) offers up a variety of close harmony pop covers and traditional and contemporary folk and gospel songs, accompanied by John Goodell on piano.\n\nMatt Watroba brings a very special set of talents to the stage. His excellent guitar playing, mellow voice, friendship with his audience, and knowledge of his presentations is impressive. Added to that is Matt's own special brand of humor. You will feel his obvious love of folk music, whether traditional or contemporary. Matt sings songs of compassion, inner strength, humor, and everyday living. \n \nHeywood Banks is simply one-of-a-kind. Equal parts genius and buffoon, this songwriter-comic-singer-poet-musician has become a cult hero and a pop icon.

Enter the sinister doctor, the Ultramagnetic visionary, Kool Keith, whose \"Feature Magnetic,\" released Sept. 16 on Mello Music Group, is his latest bizarre transformative odyssey .\n\nAs always, Keith seems unstuck in time, oblivious to geography, brilliantly mixed unflinchingly grim details with surreal, fantastical tangents. He\u2019s from the Bronx, but belongs to far-reaching astral dimensions. And Where many of his contemporaries have become legacy acts or revivalists, Keith continues to originate and perfect his wild style. He\u2019s parked behind Oracle Arena in Oakland with Norah Jones -- riding a horse and carriage through Central Park (bystanders shout that he looks like Mike Tyson). He drinks with MF DOOM in dusty London basement and recruits a legendary squadron of fellow travelers including Sadat X (Brand Nubian), Bumpy Knuckles, Boston pioneer Ed O.G., Slug from Atmosphere, and Vallejo legend Mac Mall.\n\nWSG: Kosha Dillz & Headkrack + The Bodega Brovas", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/319661255066863/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Kool Keith + Special Guests 12/16/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "date": "2016-12-16T21:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "Our League of Pointless Improvisers will invite audience members and performers to share their holiday tales, and will then create an improvised show based on these. \nNo two shows are the same! \nTickets are $10.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/718892291596571/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Crazy Holiday Feats", "date": "2016-12-16T22:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.
