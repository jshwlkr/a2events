Peter will be joined in conversation by the University of Michigan's Jesse Hoffnung-Garskof. Refreshments will be provided thanks to UM's Eisenberg Institute for Historical Studies and Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, generous co-sponsors of this event. \n\nAbout Back Channel to Cuba:\n\nHistory is being made in U.S.-Cuban relations. Updated to tell the real story behind the stunning December 17, 2014 announcement by President Obama and President Castro of their move to restore full diplomatic relations, this powerful book is essential to understanding ongoing efforts toward normalization in a new era of engagement. Challenging the conventional wisdom of perpetual conflict and aggression between the United States and Cuba since 1959, Back Channel to Cuba chronicles a surprising, untold history of bilateral efforts toward rapprochement and reconciliation. William M. LeoGrande and Peter Kornbluh here present a remarkably new and relevant account, describing how, despite the intense political clamor surrounding efforts to improve relations with Havana, negotiations have been conducted by every presidential administration since Eisenhower's through secret, back-channel diplomacy. From John F. Kennedy's offering of an olive branch to Fidel Castro after the missile crisis, to Henry Kissinger's top secret quest for normalization, to Barack Obama's promise of a new approach, LeoGrande and Kornbluh uncovered hundreds of formerly secret U.S. documents and conducted interviews with dozens of negotiators, intermediaries, and policy makers, including Fidel Castro and Jimmy Carter. They reveal a fifty-year record of dialogue and negotiations, both open and furtive, that provides the historical foundation for the dramatic breakthrough in U.S.-Cuba ties. \n\nPeter Kornbluh directs the Cuba Documentation Project and the Chile Documentation Project at the National Security Archive in Washington, DC, and is co-author, with William M. LeoGrande, of Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations Between Washington and Havana. Kornbluh is also the author of The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability and Bay of Pigs Declassified: The Secret CIA Report on the Invasion of Cuba. He writes regularly for The Nation.\n\nJesse Hoffnung-Garskof is Associate Professor of History, American Culture, and Latina/o Studies at the University of Michigan. He is the author of A Tale of Two Cities: Santo Domingo and New York After 1950.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, September 12, 2016 - 7:00pm", "date": "2016-09-12T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Peter Kornbluh", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/523370911192071/"}, {"description": "Literati is pleased to welcome Ken Foster in support of the his New York Times-bestselling memoir, The Dogs Who Found Me.\n\nIn concert with Ken's visit, we'll be holding a fundraiser for the Humane Society of Huron Valley's wonderful Bountiful Bowls program, which helps people keep pets instead of surrendering them to a shelter. HSHV accepts and distributes 40,000 pounds of pet food each year, and we're grateful for the work they do as well as their participation in this event. Food donations, as well as donations by cash or check, will be accepted at the event, or you can donate online. \n\nNow regarded as a classic in dog literature, Ken Foster's memoir chronicles his journey from first-time dog owner to rescuer\u2014and all the lessons and mistakes he made along the way. Bookended by the tragedies of 9/11 and Katrina, Foster finds that dogs open his eyes to the benefits of compassion, selflessness, and the chaotic beauty of living each day in the moment. \n\nBut more than Foster's own story, readers remember the dogs. Among them are Duque, a Costa Rican stray; Brando, Foster's first adopted dog and a supposed pit bull mix who outgrew his Manhattan studio apartment; Rocco, a clownish red pit bull whose owner mistakenly gives him away to the wrong person; Zephyr, a cheerful Rottweiler mix who awakens Foster by sitting on his chest when his heart stops working; and Sula, the tiny lost pit bull who showed up at Foster's door one day and stayed. \n\nWhether bearing witness to national tragedy, grieving the death of a friend, or dealing with his own mortality, Foster finds strength in his dogs, and in the reciprocal nature of rescue. \n\n\"Generosity and gratitude power this compelling account of the reciprocal nature of rescue. Ken Foster illuminates a profound lesson about saving a life: Doing it makes you able to do it.\"\u2013Amy Hempel, author of The Dog of the Marriage and Reasons to Live\n\nKen Foster is the editor of two anthologies, including Dog Culture, and the author of Dogs I Have Met and I\u2019m a Good Dog. His collection of short stories, The Kind I'm Likely to Get, was a New York Times Notable Book. His work has appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The San Francisco Chronicle, McSweeney's, and The Believer. He has taught at The New School, Florida State University, and the University of Southern Mississippi. In 2008, he founded The Sula Foundation, which promotes responsible dog ownership among the pit bull population and sponsors education and outreach in the New Orleans area.

In Norwegian folklore, it is a spirit who sometimes appears as a white horse that steals children away. In Nathan Hill\u2019s remarkable first novel, a Nix is anything you love that one day disappears, taking with it a piece of your heart. It\u2019s 2011, and Samuel Andresen-Anderson\u2014college professor, stalled writer\u2014has a Nix of his own: his mother, Faye. He hasn\u2019t seen her in decades, not since she abandoned the family when he was a boy. Now she\u2019s reappeared, having committed an absurd crime that electrifies the nightly news, beguiles the internet, and inflames a politically divided country. The media paints Faye as a radical hippie with a sordid past, but as far as Samuel knows, his mother was an ordinary girl, who married her high-school sweetheart. Which version of his mother is true? Two facts are certain: she\u2019s facing some serious charges, and she needs Samuel\u2019s help.\n\nTo save her, Samuel will have to embark on his own journey, uncovering long-buried secrets about the woman he thought he knew, secrets that take him across generations and countries, and stretch all the way back to Norway, the original home of the mysterious Nix. In doing so, Samuel will not only confront Faye\u2019s losses, but also his own lost love, and relearn everything he thought he knew about his mother, and himself. From the suburban Midwest to New York City to the 1968 riots that rocked Chicago, and beyond, The Nix explores\u2014with sharp humor and a fierce tenderness\u2014the resilience of love and home, even in times of radical change\n\n\"The Nix is a mother-son psychodrama with ghosts and politics, but it\u2019s also a tragicomedy about anger and sanctimony in America. Even the minor characters go to extremes\u2014among them, a Home Ec teacher from Hell and an unrepentant plagiarist with presidential aspirations. \u2018A maestro of being awful,\u2019 the son calls his mom. \u2018Every memory is really a scar,\u2019 she tells him. For this mother and son, disappointment is \u2018the price of hope\u2019\u2014a cost they will both bear. Nathan Hill is a maestro of being terrific.\" \u2014 John Irving\n\n\"Pay attention. This is what a Great American Novel looks like. The Nix is culturally relevant, politically charged, historically sweeping, sad, full of yearning, sometimes dark but mostly hilarious. Nathan Hill is a literary powerhouse who will deservedly earn many comparisons to John Irving and Jonathan Franzen.\" \u2014 Benjamin Percy\n\n\u201cOnce in a while a novel arrives at the perfect moment to reflect, skewer, and provide context for the world as we know it. This\u2014now\u2014is that novel.\u201d \u2014 Christina Baker Kline\n\nNathan Hill's short stories have appeared in The Iowa Review, AGNI, Gulf Coast, The Denver Quarterly, Fugue, The Gettysburg Review, and many other journals. He was the winner of the annual Fiction Prize from the journal Fiction, a finalist for the Donald Barthelme Prize in Short Prose, a Pushcart Prize nominee, and the recipient of an Artist Grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board.", "date": "2016-09-13T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Nathan Hill", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/547799282080505/"}]
