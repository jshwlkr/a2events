This cask version is  little softer and nuanced, but with all the loveliness of the Mosaic hops. \n\nSATURDAY: Strawberries & Cream - Cream soda meets fresh-picked strawberry in this juicy rendition of the infamous Strawberry Blonde.

She lives in Jackson with her husband, a pack of unruly designer dogs, and a cat named Karen. \n\nCori McCarthy: \n\nCori McCarthy studied poetry and screenwriting before falling in love with writing for young adults at Vermont College of Fine Arts. She is the author of You Were Here, Breaking Sky, and The Color of Rain. Breaking Sky is in development at Sony Pictures to become a film, while You Were Here is a mixed format contemporary, including word art poetry and graphic novel chapters. Cori lives in western Michigan with her family.\n\n'Charlotte Cuts It Out':\n\nLydia and I were in eighth grade when we came up with our Grand Plan to go to cosmetology school and get jobs to build our clientele while we earned business degrees. Then we\u2019d open our own salon . . .  \n\nNow Charlotte and Lydia are juniors, in a Cosmetology Arts program where they\u2019ll get on-the-job training and college credits at the same time. The Grand Plan is right on schedule.\n\nWhich means it\u2019s time for Step Two: Win the Winter Style Showcase, where Cos Arts and Fashion Design teams team up to dazzle the judges with their skills.\n\nCharlotte is sure that she and Lydia have it locked up\u2014so sure, in fact, that she makes a life-changing bet with her mother, who wants her to give up cos for college.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when things start going off the rails.\n\n'You Were Here': \n\nCori McCarthy delivers an emotionally taut page-turner from multiple points of view combined with stunning illustrations.\n\nJaycee is about to accomplish what her older brother Jake couldn't: live past graduation.\nJaycee is dealing with her brother's death the only way she can by re-creating Jake's daredevil stunts. The ones that got him killed. She's not crazy, okay? She just doesn't have a whole lot of respect for staying alive.\n\nJaycee doesn't expect to have help on her insane quest to remember Jake. But she's joined by a group of unlikely friends all with their own reasons for completing the dares and their own brand of dysfunction: the uptight, ex-best friend, the heartbroken poet, the slacker with Peter Pan syndrome, and... Mik. He doesn't talk, but somehow still challenges Jayce to do the unthinkable-reveal the parts of herself that she buried with her brother.\n\nCori McCarthy's gripping narrative defies expectation, moving seamlessly from prose to graphic novel panels and word art poetry, perfect for fans of E. Lockhart, Jennier Niven, and Jandy Nelson. From the petrifying ruins of an insane asylum to the skeletal remains of the world's largest amusement park, You Were Here takes you on an unforgettable journey of friendship, heartbreak and inevitable change.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1161062693925432/", "name": "Meet Michigan YA Authors K.
