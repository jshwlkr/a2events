At age seven she was put on the boys' soccer team. At age thirty five she would become the highest goal scorer--male or female--in the history of soccer, capturing the nation's heart with her team's 2015 World Cup Championship. Called an inspiration (and \"badass\" by President Obama), Abby has become a fierce advocate for women's rights and equal opportunity, pushing to translate the success of her team to the real world. As she reveals in this searching memoir, Abby's professional success often masked her inner struggle to reconcile the various parts of herself: ferocious competitor, daughter, leader, wife. \n\nWith stunning candor, Abby shares her inspiring and often brutal journey from girl in Rochester, New York, to world class athlete. Far more than a sports memoir, Forward is gripping tale of resilience and redemption and a reminder that heroism is, above all, about embracing life's challenges with fearlessness and heart.\n\nAbout the Event\n\nFeaturing a conversation with Doug Tribou, host of Morning Edition for Michigan Radio, and former reporter and producer for NPR's Only A Game, this event will take place at Rackham Auditorium on September 17th, 2016, at 7pm. Doors for seating will open at 6:15pm. There are two ticket options: a $10 dollar general admission ticket, and a $30 dollar general admission and hardcover book bundle. Though both ticketing options provide general admission seating, book-bundle ticket holders will have first access to the signing line following the event. Book-bundle ticket holders will pick up their books at the event, and not before. Additional copies of Forward will be available to purchase in the lobby, including a young reader's edition.\n\nGeneral admission ticket holders may also have books signed, and are asked to join the signing line after book-bundle ticket holders. Due to time constraints, Abby will only be signing books. There will no posed photographs during the signing (though you are welcome to take pictures while you are in the signing line). Books will not be personalized.", "name": "Abby Wambach", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/130844247363538/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-09-17T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "CHOOSE FROM TWO PERFORMANCE TIMES! 7 & 9 PM!\n\nDafnis Prieto, drums\nPeter Apfelbaum, saxophones\nManuel Valera, piano\nJohannes Weidenmueller, bass\n\nThe worldly rhythms of MacArthur Fellow Dafnis Prieto display an unmatched groove that stems from the roots of Afro-Caribbean hand percussion and polyrhythmic post-bop.

His style drew upon numerous international influences including, among others, Modernism and Surrealism. Although not strictly Surrealist, many of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s works manifest a similarly fantastical mood. One of the artist\u2019s most arresting qualities is his ability to imbue scenes of everyday life with an otherworldly, metaphysical power. The photographs in the exhibition, from UMMA\u2019s collections, show the artist using motifs drawn from Mexican religious and indigenous works as well as plant forms, in a Modernist approach to image making. UMMA docents will discuss these motifs and the artist\u2019s use of light as a metaphor and revealer of life, animating even the emptiest and most silent of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s scenes.", "name": "Guided Tour - Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo: Mexico's Poet of Light", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1665144867135831/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-09-19T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Literati is delighted to celebrate the publication of Blood in the Water by UM professor Heather Ann Thompson. \n\nBlood in the Water is the first definitive account of the infamous 1971 Attica prison uprising, the state's violent response, and the victims' decades-long quest for justice--including information never released to the public--published to coincide with the forty-fifth anniversary of this historic event.\n\nOn September 9, 1971, nearly 1300 prisoners took over the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York to protest years of mistreatment. Holding guards and civilian employees hostage, during the next four long days and nights the inmates negotiated with state officials for improved living conditions. On September 13, the state abruptly ended talks and sent many hundreds of heavily armed state troopers and corrections officers to retake the prison by force. In the ensuing gunfire, thirty-nine men were killed--hostages as well as prisoners--and close to one hundred were severely injured. Over the following hours, days, and weeks, troopers and officers brutally retaliated against the prisoners. For decades afterward, instead of charging any state employee who had committed murder or carried out egregious human rights abuses, New York officials only prosecuted the prisoners and failed to provide necessary support to the hostage survivors or the families of any of the men who'd been killed. \ufffd\ufffd     \n\nHeather Ann Thompson sheds new light on one of the most important civil rights stories of the last century, exploring every aspect of the uprising and its legacy from the perspectives of all of those involved in this forty-five year fight for justice: the prisoners, the state officials, the lawyers on both sides, the state troopers and corrections officers, and the families of the slain men.\n\nHeather Ann Thompson is an award-winning historian at the University of Michigan. She has written on the history of mass incarceration as well as its current impact for The New York Times, Time Magazine, The Atlantic, Salon, Dissent, New Labor Forum, and The Huffington Post. She served on a National Academy of Sciences blue-ribbon panel that studied the causes and consequences of mass incarceration in the United States and has given Congressional Staff briefings on this subject. Thompson is also the author of Whose Detroit: Politics, Labor and Race in a Modern American City and editor of Speaking Out: Protest and Activism in the 1960s and 1970s.", "name": "Heather Ann Thompson", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/245238912538964/", "source": "Facebook"}, {"date": "2016-09-20T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\nJames Cornelison\nChicago Native James Cornelison has been working as a multi-instrumentalist in Michigan for 5 years.
