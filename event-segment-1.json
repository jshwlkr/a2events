A natural poet, this young songwriter went to school on Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson, and Jack White, among others. His lyrics speak directly to a younger generation that hears, sees, and thinks about the very things he\u2019s writing. From their opening song to the finale of their set, the Ben Daniels Band cuts through with their originality, musicianship, and a sound that spans Americana, Blues, Jazz, and Rock.\nThroughout years of touring, BDB has played numerous venues in Michigan, New York City, Washington D.C., and Nashville . As a solo artist, Ben has stepped on the stage in Austin, TX at the Cactus Cafe, as well as The Barns at Wolf Trap. The son of actor Jeff Daniels, he has quietly monitored what it takes to live life as an artist. Beyond a passed down talent, the Ben Daniels Band believes in hard work, perseverance, and creatively challenging themselves and their audience.\nWith George Merkel on guitar, Tommy Reifel on bass, Wesley Fritzemeier on drums/mandolin, and Amanda Merte on percussion/vocals, BDB\u2019s live show never fails to take over the venue. With five CDs under their belts - Coming From The C, Checkin\u2019 In To The Michigan Inn, Can't You See, The Mountain Home EP, and their dual album & movie release Old Gold - the Ben Daniels Band is has grown to be a formidable group that sounds pleasantly familiar, yet unforgettably unique.\n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor. Every Thursday from Noon to 1:30pm June 2 to August 25, Sonic Lunch features a live band from an impressive array of talent in the region, as well as national and international acts. Each week a different area restaurant is on-site selling a Sonic Lunch for concert-goers to purchase. Other restaurants offer special discounts for concert-goers to pick up to take to the park.\n\nSonic Lunch concerts are free and suitable for all ages. Seating is available but lawn chairs are welcome. Come join the crowds for an energizing mid-day break or just relax and enjoy the sounds.\n\nSonic Lunch is the result of a collaborative effort spearheaded by Bank of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Radio (107.1fm) and their popular morning host, Martin Bandyke provide promotion support and host each concert. Perich Advertising & Design, a local advertising agency, contributes the annual design of Sonic Lunch posters, banners, t-shirts and stickers. As a result, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch has become one of the coolest summer events in Ann Arbor.\n\nUpdates on show and weather\nSonic Lunch on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/soniclunch\nSonic Lunch on Twitter\nhttp://www.twitter.com/soniclunch \n\n\"LIKE\"\nBank of Ann Arbor on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bankofannarbor", "name": "Ben Daniels Band / June 30th / Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch / 12PM FREE"}, {"date": "2016-06-30T18:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/187093148358921/", "description": "Join us every Thursday in June to help support our community partner, Growing Hope!

From fresh apple pie to Budweiser, the Star Spangled Banner to Party in the USA, what is the modern American experience? Are we entering the sci-fi World of Tomorrow, longing for the Norman Rockwell past, or painting ourselves into an Idiocracy?
