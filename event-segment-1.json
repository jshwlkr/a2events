The band, which includes Channy Leaneagh, dual drummers, Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu and Chris Beirden on bass with producer Ryan Olson at the helm, collectively wrote the album in Minneapolis in the winter of 2015 during their first true break from two straight years of touring. The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room. There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings. United Crushers is the follow up to 2013\u2019s Shulamith which EW called \"propulsive enough for dance floors, and dreamy enough for headphones\" andMOJO said \"proves that intelligent pop music still has the ability to seduce and enthral.\" Their debut, 2012's Give You The Ghost, also garnered international acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"the sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously\" and Q praising it as \"a bewitching, urgent, magical debut.\" The band has conquered massive festivals around the world from Coachella to Glastonbury in addition to performing on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Later With Jools Holland and more.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/564", "name": "Polica w/ Mothxr 4/18/16 @ Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-18T20:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/769930223136488/"}, {"description": "Oats & Woes & Babo, Oh My!\n\nBabo presents Oats & Woes Ann Arbor a local oatmeal pop-up!

A Pittsburgh native, Moore has been a human jukebox in dive bars, a songsmith on festival stages, and a hootenanny revivalist. Eric\u2019s stellar fingerstyle work bumps down the jagged, thorny backroads of the Mississippi delta and skips over the seas to the British Isles. \n\nWhile he was working as a river guide in Grand Teton Nat\u2019l Park, he frequented the  legendary Hootenanny at Dornans in Jackson Hole, WY. The Hoot\u2019s mandate on traditional music was a scourge to many a songwriter, but not so for Moore. He began a spirited inquiry into acoustic guitar styles and the pre-war songbook. Taking cues from players like Bert Jansch, John Martyn, Archie Fisher and the Delta Blues great Tommy Johnson, Moore brings fresh arrangements and decades of performing experience to his spirited originals and traditional music from both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Eric Moore", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-19T19:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1699294757015373/"}, {"description": "Can you feel it?
