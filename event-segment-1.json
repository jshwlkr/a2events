Submissions can be no longer than two minutes in length.\n\nAnd the coolest part - We will be taking your video and using it as the suggestion for an improv scene!!! IT'S A FREAKING VIDEO NIGHT/IMPROV JAM!!! People will LITERALLY be DISSECTING your video in the name of improvised comedy. What will they do with it??? Show up to find out.\n\nSend your finished product to pointlessvideoshorts@gmail.com no later than the Saturday before the video night. And finally, come and watch the crowd go wild over your creative and hysterical work of digital media art.\n\nNot into making vids but love watching them? Submit your favorite one from YouTube related to that month\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d and we might play it on that Sunday! That\u2019s right, you can share with the world that video you accidentally stumbled upon late one night while browsing the interwebs that made you cry with laughter.\n\nOf course, you are not required to participate in any way. Simply come, enjoy a microbrew, sit back and laugh with some fellow funny people.

Even if you are thinking about it, you can click \"Interested\" so you can get updates on this page. Do this by 5:00pm, the day of the show. This does not guarantee you a spot, but not doing it puts you at the bottom of the list.\n\n- After 5:00pm Sunday, \"show ups\" can \"go up\" only if spots are available.\n- The line-up will be created after the 8:00 Stage Time show presented by the Emergent Arts Theater.\n- Those arriving after the line-up is finalized will be given spots as time permits.\n- Length of stage time will depend largely on the turn out, performer's experience, and the show-runner's discretion.\n- As always, if you show up and do not get a spot, you will be put at the top of the list for the next show.\n\n--- Want to increase your odds of getting a spot? Here's some DO's and DON'T's\nDO . . . . Share this event page with your fans on your fan page, your facebook page, your website, or your tweets, or any other social media.\nDO . . . . Volunteer for less time. If you are willing to do 3 rather than 5, or 4 rather than 7, then you are more likely to get a spot.\nDO . . . . Come to the paid shows.\nDO . . . . Stay for \"meet and greet\" after shows.\nDO . . . . Answer poll questions whenever they appear on the event page.\nDO . . . . Bring people. This is not, I repeat NOT, a \"bringer.\" But if somebody has come to see you, it will be very hard to deny you a spot. In the past, we've had shows where we've added a minute of time for every person the comic brought as a non-performing audience member. Bring three people and a five minute spot becomes an eight minute spot.\n\nContact Mark at: www.facebook.com/marksweetman", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-10T21:30:00-04:00", "name": "The UNclub at The Yellow Barn (4/10/16)"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/857480274361121/", "description": "FRESH + FIT!\nStarting April 1, babo and FitPoint  want to help you optimize your diet and fitness.

Economically, politically and culturally, because it was the pursuit of pepper that led Columbus to sail west across the Atlantic. Culinarily because the Columbian Exchange that followed brought tomatoes, potatoes, corn and cacao to the Eastern Hemisphere; cows, goats, and pigs among others went west. And, probably above all, because very few of us sit down to eat a meal that hasn\u2019t been spiced with peppercorns in one way or another.\n\nFor this special meal we\u2019ve put together the culinary talents of Roadhouse Chef Alex Young and Philippe de Vienne, master pepper trader for over thirty years. Together they\u2019ve put together a menu that features some of THE finest peppercorns the world has to offer, all right here at the Roadhouse in form of one delicious meal, all personally selected the de Vienne family who have rightly earned their moniker of Spice Traders by traveling the globe and searching for the most remarkable spices anywhere.\n\nMise en Bouche:\nGrilled Issan Chicken wings\nwith green pepper and garlic, hot sweet and sour dip\n\nAppetizer:\nIsekaya-Style Fish Tartare\nwith sancho pepper, nori and toasted sesame\n\nEntree Choices:\nBraised Cornman Farms\u2019 Pork\nwith figs, almonds and sweet and sour Long pepper sauce\nOR\nSlow Roasted Goat\nwith cubebs, white pepper and lemon grass shallot sauce\n\nDessert:\nChocolate Voatsiperifery Pot de Cr\u00eame", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-12T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "In Pursuit of Pepper"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1686417714974855/", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n-          April 12 - NEW DATE\u2013 Nick Zomparelli \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pingpongtheband\nhttps://www.facebook.com/daughtersofeternity/\nMulti-instrumentalist Nick Zomparelli (Ping Pong, Daughters of Eternity) performs an eclectic blend of originals and covers with a vibe so nice.\n\n-          April 19 - TBA\n\n-         April 26 - Heather Schwartz\nhttp://www.heatherschwartzmusic.com/\nHeather Schwartz has become known for creating a unique concert experience, with a vintage charm and passionate vocals she truely connects with her audience.
