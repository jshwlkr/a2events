It may look like magic when the ShopBot, plasma cutter, Tormach, or other machine accurately cuts an intricate shape, but in fact we have some powerful software tools that  let even beginners create fantastic projects.\n\nThis class is an overview of \u201cCNC\u201d\u2013that is, computer controlled machines.  You\u2019ll learn what CAD means, the difference between 2D and 3D, and other concepts.  We will do some very simple hands-on activities, including creating a drawing in a CAD program, using a CAM program to generate code to run on a CNC machine, and each person will send their job to a simple CNC machine and see it run!\n\nIf you have no CNC experience, this would be a great class to take before checkout classes for specific CNC machines. \n\nThere is no prerequisite for this class, but familiarity with using software on a computer will be needed\u2013things like clicking with the mouse and so on.\n\nNotes and other handouts will be provided.\n\nBe sure to check out our CNC toolchain map (which we\u2019ll explain in class) and CNC glossary at http://maker-works.com/cadcam-toolchain/\n\nClass size: 4 people\n\nPlease arrive 10 minutes early if this is your first time to Maker Works.\nCall Maker Works at 734-222-4911 or visit http://www.supersaas.com/schedule/makerworks/CheckOut?day=14&month=12&year=2016&view=day to sign up!", "name": "Intro to CNC - $25"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1574155032886638/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-14T20:00:00-05:00", "description": "Wed.

Sign up for the street team by clicking here: http://bit.ly/2b3tDvt\n\nDOPAPOD: \n\nThe Boston born, now generally Northeast based, but ever on-the-go Dopapod has come a long way from their college basement, DIY party roots. While maintaining to be as grassroots as their humble beginnings, the group has earned praise from taste making critics like Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, Jambase, Relix, and The Boston Herald, all the while tending to their ever expanding community of devoted listeners. The past 4 years have individually held the weight of about 150 shows, which have included numerous festival appearances like Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Summer Camp, Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, Peach Fest, & Gathering Of the Vibes. All of this time on stage with each other has given the band the opportunity to explore the wide variety of influences that has impacted them to be the players they are today. But, don\u2019t be quick to think that the no holds barred experimentation is unguided. While the brush in their hand uses every color, it\u2019s the stroke on the canvas that gives Dopapod a distinct voice in the way of crafty songwriting.\n\nThat calculated, compositional mindset and restless nature to never sit too still is what has allowed Dopapod to fully realize their fourth studio release, Never Odd Or Even. Guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa giddily tells, \u201cWe really felt that the material this time around represented a big leap forward, not just in the way we\u2019ve been interacting as a band, but in the way our focus has become sharper in paying attention to things like melody, theme, lyrical imagery, and structure \u2013 all the elements that make a great song.\u201d\n\nDetermined to have that maturity translate in the studio, the band enlisted friend and producer Jason \u201cJocko\u201d Randall to both engineer and produce the record. Keys/vocalist Eli Winderman couldn\u2019t be happier about how things went. \u201cWe lived at his studio for about a month for these sessions and it just clicked right away. Jocko immediately became another member of band in many ways. With his attitude and approach to the recording process, we were able to really dial in the sounds we wanted, get those perfect takes we were aiming for, and have a blast the whole way through.\u201d Released in November of 2014, Never Odd Or Even serves as the spark that the band has ignited to launch them into and exciting 2015.", "name": "Dopapod & Pigeons Playing Ping Pong at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/324709987912141/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-12-15T08:00:00-05:00", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.
