Performances are Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. All tickets are $12, with a $2 discount at the Sunday performance for those bringing a photo\u2014printed or on a cell phone\u2014of them with their dog, or a non-perishable pet supply donation. In collaboration with the Humane Society of Huron Valley, donations of pet supplies and food, as well as monetary donations, will be accepted at every performance. Tickets are available by calling the office at 734-971-2228, or at the door.  Additional information is available by visiting www.a2ct.org.  \nSylvia finds Greg and Kate, recent empty-nesters, at a cross roads in their relationship. Kate is a middle school English teacher who fills the void with a renewed commitment to her career. Greg, on the other hand, flounders in a job he has grown to dislike and a surplus of free time. Enter Sylvia, a disarming dog of unknown origins whom Greg finds unattended in Central Park. Greg brings Sylvia home, much to Kate\u2019s displeasure. As the bond between Greg and Sylvia grows, a chasm opens in Greg and Kate\u2019s marriage into which friends, a well-meaning fellow dog owner, and a misguided therapist fall. With sharp wit and biting satire, A.R. Gurney explores the age-old connection between man and his best friend.\n\u201cI saw a scene from Sylvia in an acting showcase a few years ago and fell in love with the play,\u201d says director Cassie Mann. \u201cHaving a young woman play a dog\u2014not in a dog suit but as a fully-conversant human with dog tendencies--is a brilliant device. The audience gets to experience the inner life of a dog as well as the relationships between Sylvia and those around her. The comedy builds as the relationship between Sylvia and Greg grows, but there\u2019s also a poignant message about how a longtime couple navigates their post-child-rearing years.\u201d\n\nThe cast of Sylvia features Stacy Buck as Sylvia, Larry Rusinsky as Greg, and Denyse Clayton as Kate. The cast also includes Lonnie Curri, Dave Giles, and Celeste Green. \n\nSylvia contains adult themes and languages and is intended for mature audiences. ***", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/199447367142600/", "date": "2016-10-01T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Parisian Soir\u00e9e: Celebrating 32 Years!", "description": "\u201cTo hear a number of Ann Arbor's top-notch talent perform together in a fun, laid-back atmosphere for an evening was certainly a real treat.
