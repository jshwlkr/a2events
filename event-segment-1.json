A time for nerds of all kinds to come together and talk of many things. This time around, we\u2019re talking about what medical diagnostic tests can (and cannot) tell us, sustainable living in a solar-powered house made of straw, and how time is dumb - we\u2019re looking at you, Daylight Saving Time!\n\nTesting, testing! NNA2 alum and PhD/MD student Carl Engelke is here to talk about medical testing - the how, the why, and the reality of what some of these common screening exams can and can\u2019t tell us. Science!\n\nHay is for houses! Professor, designer, and farmer Joe Trumpey built his house out of straw and field rocks and determination and ingenuity, and he\u2019s here to tell you the practical side of transitioning to an off-the-grid, sustainable lifestyle.\n\n(H)our third speaker is engineer Matt Carpenter - he\u2019ll take a moment to explain the stories behind leap years and the agony and ecstasy that is falling back and springing forward with Daylight Saving Time. \n\nSo text the friend you\u2019ve been meaning to hang out with and come see us for Tests, Transition, & Time: How to save lives, energy, and daylight at LIVE on First St, Thursday, 3/23, doors at 6:30 pm.", "name": "NNA2 #43: Tests, Transition, & Time"}, {"date": "2017-03-23T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1820736668190406/", "description": "Literati is thrilled to welcome Lindy West in celebration of the paperback release of her memoir, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman, a New York Times bestseller, winner of the 2016 Stranger Genius Award for Literature, and a staff pick here at Literati.\n\nShrill is an uproarious memoir, a feminist rallying cry in a world that thinks gender politics are tedious and that women, especially feminists, can't be funny. Coming of age in a culture that demands women be as small, quiet, and compliant as possible--like a porcelain dove that will also have sex with you--writer and humorist Lindy West quickly discovered that she was anything but. From a painfully shy childhood in which she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her big body and even bigger opinions; to her public war with stand-up comedians over rape jokes; to her struggle to convince herself, and then the world, that fat people have value; to her accidental activism and never-ending battle royale with Internet trolls, Lindy narrates her life with a blend of humor and pathos that manages to make a trip to the abortion clinic funny and wring tears out of a story about diarrhea.\n\nWith inimitable good humor, vulnerability, and boundless charm, Lindy boldly shares how to survive in a world where not all stories are created equal and not all bodies are treated with equal respect, and how to weather hatred, loneliness, harassment, and loss, and walk away laughing. Shrill provocatively dissects what it means to become self-aware the hard way, to go from wanting to be silent and invisible to earning a living defending the silenced in all caps.\n\nLindy West is a Seattle-based writer, editor, and performer whose work focuses on pop culture, social justice, humor, and body image. She's currently a culture writer for GQ magazine and GQ.com and a weekly columnist at The Guardian, as well as the founder and editor of I Believe You | It's Not Your Fault, an advice blog for teens. In 2015 she wrote and recorded a story for This American Life about confronting an Internet troll who impersonated her dead father. She also was listed as \"Internet's Most Fascinating of 2015\" by Cosmopolitan.com, and helped launch the viral #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag in defense of women's reproductive rights.\n \n\nEvent date: \nThursday, March 23, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.
