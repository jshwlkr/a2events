Her work has appeared in Guernica, The Prague Review, The Offing, The Rumpus, and been nominated for a Pushcart Prize. She worked in magazines, politics, and public relations in the U.K and her native New Zealand before moving to the U.S. She holds an MFA from Columbia College Chicago. In her debut essay collection, New Zealand native Toni Nealie examines journeys, homelands, family, and motherhood.

About The Telling: Zoe Zolbrod remained silent about her early childhood molestation for nearly a decade. When she finally decided to tell, she wasn't sure what to expect, or what to say.

Recording for the first time as a solo artist and writing without what he refers to as \"the shackles of genre\", the direction is really a culmination of the variety in his past projects. The sound is still very much grounded in American Roots music but is unbound by the narrow concepts he has applied to previous outings. \n\nRyan Racine first made a name for himself as the front man of Ann Arbor\u2019s rockabilly outfit Lucky Haskins. Formed when he was only 15, the band burst onto the metro Detroit rockabilly scene and quickly garnered attention and a loyal fan base. Besides introducing the genre to a whole new generation in the area, they earned spots opening for legends like Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Lee Rocker as well as a slot in the 1995 Detroit Music Awards.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/238153536539884/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Ryan Racine"}, {"date": "2016-05-17T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Spring has arrived, semeters are ending... come celebrate with us.
