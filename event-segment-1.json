Enter, at this particularly challenging moment, a miraculous email: can\u2019t go, it\u2019s all paid for, just book a flight to Miami. Thus began a journey that would lead to the Bahamas and to David Pinder, a legendary bonefishing guide. Bonefish are prized for their elusiveness and their tenacity. And no one was better at hunting them than Pinder, a Bahamian whose accuracy and patience were virtuosic. He knows what the fish think, said one fisherman, before they think it. By the time Dombrowski meets Pinder, however, he has been abandoned by the industry he helped build. With cataracts from a lifetime of staring at the water and a tiny severance package after forty years of service, he watches as the world of his beloved bonefish is degraded by tourists he himself did so much to attract. But as Pinder\u2019s stories unfold, Dombrowski discovers a profound integrity and wisdom in the guide\u2019s life.\n\n\"A brilliant book. Destined to be a classic.\"\u2014Jim Harrison\n\nBorn in Michigan, Chris Dombrowski earned his MFA from the University of Montana. His publications include two collections of poems, By Cold Water (2009) and Earth Again (2013). His poetry and nonfiction have been widely published in leading journals and magazines.

Professor Philip J. Deloria is this installment's featured guest.\n\nSweetland's Word Squared: Writer to Writer series lets you hear directly from University of Michigan professors about their challenges, processes, and expectations as writers and also as readers of student writing. Each semester,Word\u00b2 pairs one esteemed University professor with a Sweetland faculty member for a conversation about writing.\n\nWord\u00b2 sessions are broadcast live on WCBN radio. These conversations offer students a rare glimpse into the writing that professors do outside the classroom.

Professors will also discuss what they want from student writers in their courses, and will take questions put forth by students and by other members of the University community. If there's anything you've ever wanted to ask a professor about writing, Word\u00b2 gives you the chance.\n\nProfessor Deloria is the Carroll Smith-Rosenberg Collegiate Professor of American Culture and History, former LSA Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education, and past Director of the Program in American Culture and the AC Native American Studies program.
