These days, too many people struggle to place Poland on a map and even have trouble identifying West Virginia.

Not your typical sports memoir, Chasing Water also contains arresting black-and-white drawings and a graphic story extra, as well as an inventive and mercurial narrative style that morphs chapter by chapter to reflect Ervin\u2019s restless, multifaceted life. Ervin won a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games at the age of nineteen. He is an athlete branded with a slew of titles including being the first US Olympic swimmer of African American descent, along with Jewish heritage, who also grew up with Tourette\u2019s syndrome. He shocked the sporting world by retiring soon after claiming two world titles following the 2000 Olympics. Auctioning off his gold medal for charity, he set off on a part spiritual quest, part self-destructive bender that involved Zen temples, fast motorcycles, tattoo parlors, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands. Then Ervin resurfaced in 2012 to not only make the US Olympic team twelve years after his first appearance, but to continue his career by swimming faster than ever before, and faster than anyone else. \n\n\"Here Ervin and swim trainer and journalist Markides combine talents to create a biography that is part first-hand narrative by Ervin, with Markides filling in the details and providing context. The formula works, pulling readers into Ervin's experience of the thrill of victory and search for meaning....Featuring more depth, breadth, truth, and the effects of reckless choices than found in traditional athlete biographies, this gripping account is just in time for the gear up to the Rio 2016 Olympics. Readers will understand the psyche and life of elite athletes as never before, then cheer Ervin on in his attempt to make another Olympic team.\"--Library Journal\n\n\"A celebrated Olympian recounts how he rose to the top of his sport, crashed, and found redemption....This book, which tells his story through a narrative that interweaves the former gold medalist's memories with commentary by his friend and colleague Markides, reveals the extreme highs and lows that characterized Ervin's remarkable life and career....The author never flinches at revealing his less-than-perfect past, and the humility he demonstrates at coming to terms with his own egotism and personal shortcomings makes the book frequently compelling. A provocative and refreshingly honest redemption memoir.\"--Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"Markides smartly combines his own journalistic account with a parallel narrative in which Ervin...explains his life and style. Some talents simply defy explanation, however, and Ervin may be in that category....The story of his comeback at 31 (ancient for a swimmer) is rendered more amazing by the contrast with what went before.\"--Booklist \n\n\"Most memoirs from Olympians are puff pieces, ghost-written so blandly you fall asleep trying to make it to the end of the first chapter. Chasing Water is the opposite of that, an intimate, visceral experience you will appreciate.\"--SwimSwam \n\n\"A refreshingly unexpected athlete biography void of eye-rolling, cliched, self help propaganda bullshit.\"--Gary Hall, Jr., swimmer, ten-time Olympic medalist", "name": "Anthony Ervin & Constantine Markides", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-15T19:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1635855363397658/"}, {"description": "Thursday, September 15 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nGold Panda wsg: Open Mike Eagle\n\nThe story of Gold Panda\u2019s journey from an acclaimed debut record to now, as he prepares to release his third full length album, is an entirely circular one. Hailing from Chelmsford Essex in the UK, in the six years since the release of his genre-defining debut album \u2018Lucky Shiner\u2019, the electronic artist most comfortable with the moniker Derwin Panda spent the subsequent years splitting the majority of his time between London, Berlin and countless excursions to Japan. As he created his third album \u2018\u2019Good Luck And Do Your Best\u2019 he ultimately found himself back where he began, in the East of England.\n\nOrigin stories can be fundamentally boring by nature, packed with non-essential details and overly stressed homilies to roots and influences. But the core nature of an artist that has produced some of the most beloved and emotionally-infused electronic music of this decade is deeply rooted in the constant desire to return to where his musical world began.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/710", "name": "Gold Panda w/ Open Mike Eagle 9/15/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-15T21:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1186311131413949/"}, {"description": "Michigan Electronic Dance Music Association (MEDMA) & Necto present..\n\nDue to illness Stefano Noferini had to cancel his show for this Thursday. No worries! Dirty Birds own Ardalan is here to save the day!\n\nARDALAN\n\nwith opening sets by MEDMA\nMain Floor & Patio\n\nAbout Ardalan:\nRange, appeal and a massive dose of nasty, gritty bass are the three chief weapons every Dirtybird artist has in his quiver, but Ardalan seems to be the peak culmination of all those assets in one wieldy point. This young archer has had the incomprehensible luck to fall into crew with his idols, be reared by their best and given some of their most guarded musical secrets, then hoisted to a platform to blare his prodigious beats from places where most creators can only dream of being.\nBorn in Tehran, Iran, Ardalan possesses a peculiar, fresh perspective on music genesis without even trying. His mixes, remixes and dubs are known for their sass, energy and wickedly wry samples that snap like a wet towel to the face, but his original records are where his efforts shine, like those released with Justin Martin \u2014\u201cMr. Spock,\u201d a 2010 party anthem charted by Diplo and Jesse Rose, \u201cLEZGO,\u201d charted by Dog Blood (Skrillex and Boyz Noise) and \u201cFunction\u201d, the 2015 banger that keeps giving \u2014 as well as two of his own EP\u2019s that were released on Dirtybird, \u201cThe Yeah / No\u201d and \u201cThunderdad\u201d. It is no wonder he has been given the nod by everyone, from Papa Dirtybird himself (Claude VonStroke) and A-Trak, to those who are charting his remixes, like Maya Jane Coles, Audiojack, and Riva Starr.\nThe greatest strength in Ardy\u2019s music is his ability to whip out hits that work equally well from the dankest basements to the most opulent dance-floors; sounds that satisfy those with diverse tastes who can unite under his single agenda of having a good time.\n\nAbout MEDMA:\nMEDMA is a student group of music fans, musicians, producers, and DJs focused on spreading the awareness and appreciation of electronic music on campus as well as in Ann Arbor. They host and attend events all around Ann Arbor, on the University of Michigan campus, and Detroit. MEDMA also sponsors DJ tutorials and music mastering workshops throughout the school year.
