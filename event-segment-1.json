Humanity, happiness, and the survival of the biosphere spin each section forward, species are wiped out, yet the poem endures. \n\n\u201cIn Make Yourself Happy, Eleni Sikelianos evinces a neuro-psychological state counter to the miswrought biology that has haunted the Occident since the dawn of Roman times. These poems open the neurology to its whole participation in the psycho-physical field and are not unlike the seminal amplification of indigenous culture, where the language of the body simultaneously circulates with living metastates. These poems organically form as environmental respiration that only the poet can approach in the latter days of this techno-hypercritical epoch.\u201d \u2014Will Alexander\n\n\u201cThis poem is addressed to you. You want to be happy, don\u2019t you? In deceptively simple sentences, it tells you how to \u2018make yourself happy.\u2019 You might aspirate on honey, for instance. Play connect the dots and the extinct animals pop out. Did you kill them all to make yourself happy? Here you will bask in the syllabic glow of the \u2018shirred / aggregates / mineral iridium / irresidue.\u2019 This book is your invitation to the post-human pool party of the future.\u201d \u2014Rae Armantrout\n\n\u201cWith her native Greek wisdom and her American exuberance, Eleni takes us into the different layers which make our daily lives, perceptions, thoughts . . . as they take form, and thanks to her become an initiatique, even archeological, journey. Besides the pleasure we feel, we see here a moral endeavor, an invitation to make ourselves happy. Her journey finds its energy in her perfect ear for language and immense generosity of heart. Her openness lets in the sinuosities and cracks of what we may well end up calling \u2018being,\u2019 in her great project of telling us, in these worst moments of actual history, to be (urgently) happy because we are . . . happy. And let me share at least one epiphany: \u2018to graze in / winter in snow- / free meadows.\u2019\u201d \u2014Etel Adnan\n\nEleni Sikelianos is the author of six books of poetry, most recently The Loving Detail of the Living and the Dead and The California Poem, which was a Barnes & Noble Best of the Year, as well as hybrid memoirs, The Book of Jon and You Animal Machine (The Golden Greek). Sikelianos teaches in the Creative Writing Program at the University of Denver. A California native, longtime New Yorker, and world traveler, she now lives in Boulder with her husband, the novelist Laird Hunt, and their daughter, Eva Grace.\n\nEvent date: \nThursday, February 23, 2017 - 7:00pm", "date": "2017-02-23T19:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1997490890478309/", "name": "Poetry at Literati: Eleni Sikelianos"}, {"description": "Join us for a rousing evening of Kander & Ebb's best songs, in new, inventive arrangements and mashups, at Conor O'Neill's Irish Pub in Ann Arbor!

This two-part exhibition (Part I: Figuration followed by Part II: Abstraction on view July 1\u2013 October 29) presents works collected by a diverse group of alumni that represent the breadth of the University and over seventy years of graduating classes. The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vige\u0301e Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term \u201cfiguration\u201d. It also offers an unprecedented opportunity to view art that may have never been publicly displayed otherwise\u2014and most certainly, not all together. For visitors, and especially for future Michigan alumni, Victors for Art illuminates the shared passion for art fostered by the Michigan experience.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by Joseph Rosa, Guest Curator, in collaboration with Laura De Becker, Helmut & Candis Stern Associate Curator of African Art, Jennifer Friess, Assistant Curator of Photography, Lehti Mairike Keelman, Assistant Curator of Western Art, and Natsu Oyobe, Curator of Asian Art.\n\nLead support for Victors for the Arts: Michigan's Alumni Collectors is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost, the University of Michigan Health System, the University of Michigan Office of the President, the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs and the National Endowment for the Arts, and the University of Michigan Bicentennial Office.", "date": "2017-02-24T11:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1724899501156129/", "name": "Victors for Art: Michigan's Alumni Collectors\u2013Part I: Figuration"}, {"description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "date": "2017-02-24T15:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1138729056224663/", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe"}, {"description": "There's no winter warmer like the Winter Beer Festival!
