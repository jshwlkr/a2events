Beginning in 2010, Opie spent six months taking photographs at the Bel Air, California, residence of Elizabeth Taylor (1932\u20132011). The exhibition includes 50 works drawn from two series, Closets and Jewels and 700 Nimes Road. Opie\u2019s lens captures the essence of the Hollywood legend through her personal objects and mementos, and portrays Taylor\u2019s life experience and eccentricity as an illusory subject, one that cannot be specifically designated or precisely described. In the artist\u2019s words, the project is not about the relationship to celebrity but about \u201cthe relationship to what is human.\u201d\nCatherine Opie: 700 Nimes Road is organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. This exhibition is made possible with lead support provided by J.P. Morgan Private Bank and major support from Jamie McCourt, and Gilena Simons.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1761827144051389/", "date": "2016-06-11T11:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Catie Newell: Overnight", "description": "Detroit-based architect Catie Newell\u2019s work is focused on the tactile, sensory qualities of the materials we use to build things: their texture, density, or malleability. Her investigations combine architectural research, material studies, and art experiments, a strategy she began as a student that now defines her career.\n\nThe most important element in her formal vocabulary is light, not only as a \u201cmaterial\u201d in its own right, but also as a condition. Varying in strength, form, and duration, light constructs architecture as a situational experience rather than a fixed space. Newell\u2019s fascination with light is a fascination with darkness. Through urban interventions, installations, and photographs, she investigates how darkness creates alternate environments, with unseen geographies, untold histories, and secret identities.\n\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/507910882734023/", "date": "2016-06-11T11:00:00-04:00"}]
