What was their relationship to Jesus? Tom Bissell gives us rich and deeply informed answers to these ancient and surprisingly elusive questions. He examines not just who these men were (and weren't), but how their identities have taken shape over the course of two millennia. He makes clear that, ultimately, their story is the story of Christianity and its growth from an obscure Jewish sect to the global faith we know today. Bissell has visited holy sites from Rome and Jerusalem to Turkey, India, and Kyrgyzstan, and he vividly captures the rich diversity of Christianity's global reach. Written with warmth, humor, and rare acumen, Apostle is a brilliant synthesis of travel writing, biblical history, and a deep lifelong relationship with Christianity. The result is an unusual, erudite, at times hilarious book a religious, intellectual, and personal adventure.\n\nTom Bissell was born in Escanaba, Michigan, in 1974. He has lived in New York City, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Italy, Las Vegas, Estonia, Portland, and currently lives in Los Angeles. In 2006 he was awarded the Rome Prize, and in 2010 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. He has also done scriptwriting for several popular video-game franchises, including Gears of War, Battlefield, and Uncharted.", "name": "Tom Bissell", "date": "2016-03-24T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1581383522183183/", "description": "Come celebrate Irish week here at babo!\n\nWe will be offering 10% off all green juices, Irish lattes, and beer on draft. \n\nAnd don't forget about our delicious Irish food specials!\n\nSee our menu below!\n\nHowever, you will be celebrating we have options for you!\n\nBABO IRISH WEEK\nMonday, March. 14th \u2013Sunday, Mar. 20th\n\nFOOD SPECIALS\n\nSANDWICH OF THE WEEK\n\nCORNED BEEF SANDWICH\ncrust bakery rye, housemade corned beef, braised cabbage slaw, whole grain mustard, swiss cheese\n\nENTREE OF THE WEEK\n\nRYE-CRUSTED CORNED BEEF\nbraised corned beef with toasted caraway, crust bakeries rye bread crumbs, topped with rich caraway gravy\n\nVEGETARIAN ENTREE OF THE WEEK\n\nBRAISED CABBAGE\nslow braised cabbage, onion, and tomatoes seasoned with garlic, onion, thyme, and fennel seed\n\nFEATURED SIDES\n\nROSTI POTATOES\nshredded potato pancake filled with roasted shallots, thyme, and cheddar cheese\n\nROASTED ROOT VEGETABLE MEDLEY\ncarrots, parsnips, turnips, fennel, garlic, thyme, and Guinness stout glaze", "name": "Babo Irish Week", "date": "2016-03-24T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1577492092573060/", "description": "All About Eve (Katie Geddes and Deb Wood) and Michael Krieger present the story of Good Friday, told through the music of Indigo Girls, Natalie Merchant, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, along with scripture and prayer.\n \n                               30 minute service\n                    repeats at 7:30pm and 8:00pm\n            Enter at any time; stay as long as you like\n              (worship service; no admission charge)", "name": "Good Friday Evening Vigil featuring All About Eve and Michael Krieger", "date": "2016-03-25T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/487821191409092/", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers.\n\nGroup 1: \"The Real Thing\" starring Nathan Corliss and Mat De Lisle\n\nGroup 2: \"Doom and Doomer\" starring Jeremy Conn and Jenny Bloomer\n\nGroup 3: \"The League of Pointless Improvisers\" starring Andy Reid, Jason Valentini, Matt Swartz, Matthew Flickinger, Mitch Socia, and Moni Jones", "name": "Pointless Improv with The Real Thing and Doom and Doomer", "date": "2016-03-25T20:00:00-04:00"}]
