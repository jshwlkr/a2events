The audition process will be the same as the first round's - more information below.\n\nThe Civic Improv Ensemble is excited to announce auditions for the second season of the new A2CT endeavor. The Ensemble is a great place for both new and experienced improvisers to form brand new troupes of enthusiastic actors who will spend a year developing their improv skills and performing together. Our previous troupes have performed around southeast Michigan, and former CIE members have been cast at Pointless Brewery & Theatre, Planet Ant Theatre, and Go Comedy! Improv Theater.\n\nAuditions will take place at the A2CT Studio (322 W. Ann St, Ann Arbor) on Friday, February 10 from 7:00-9:00, and Saturday, February 11 from 6:00-8:00. Auditioners must be at least 18 years old, and need attend only one of the two audition days, but should plan to stay the entire time if possible. No pre-registration is required - please arrive a few minutes early to fill out an audition form.\n\nNo preparation or previous experience is required for auditions, which will consist of a variety of short improv games and some basic two-person scene work. We are looking for actors with good energy, a willingness to take chances, and the ability to listen closely on stage and react honestly. Please wear comfortable clothes and be prepared to move. The only fee for Civic Improv is the standard membership fee for all A2CT actors - $25 per year.\n\nEach of our three coaches is looking to cast a troupe of 6 to 12 actors. The three troupes will be:\n\nShort-Form Troupe - coached by Shelly Smith\nThis troupe will focus on short-form games like those featured on Whose Line Is It Anyway or at ComedySportz. This is a great place for those brand new to improv to start out, as well as quick-witted quipsters and anyone who's a fan of fun.\n\nMid-Form Troupe - coached by Jen Delisi\nLearn to create longer scene-based stories in this troupe. Jen introduces improvisers to a variety of tools for bridging the gap between short-form games and long-form scene work. With a clap of their hands, your fellow improvisers will send your characters to unusual locations and hilarious new situations.\n\nLong-Form Troupe - coached by David Widmayer\nScene work is the core of long-form improv - improvisers will learn to walk onto a blank stage with nothing but a simple suggestion and create unique, complex characters and a whole world for them to inhabit. This troupe will be introduced to a variety of scenic forms, and ultimately choose and develop a signature format to bring to their performances.\n\nPlease email David Widmayer (djwidmayer@gmail.com) with any questions.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/736458266531240/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Civic Improv Auditions!
