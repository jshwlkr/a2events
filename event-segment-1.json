Her mother is too humiliated by Ada's twisted foot to let her outside. So when her little brother Jamie is shipped out of London to escape the war, Ada doesn't waste a minute - she sneaks out to join him.\n\nSo begins a new adventure of Ada, and for Susan Smith, the woman who is forced to take the two kids in. As Ada teaches herself to ride a pony, learns to read, and watches for German spies, she begins to trust Susan - and Susan begins to love Ada and Jamie. But in the end, will their bond be enough to hold them together through wartime? Or will Ada and her brother fall back into the cruel hands of their mother?\n\nThis masterful work of historical fiction is equal parts adventure and a moving tale of family and identity - a classic in the making.\nhttps://goo.gl/E5IKtO\n---\n* As always, we'll spend the first hour talking literature at the Jim Toy Community Center, and the second hour having drinks/snacks at the the Aut Bar.\n* Don't forget that we take up a small collection for use of the Community Center.
