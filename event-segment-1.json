It's a constantly moving showcase of two television icons who pull no punches when battering the audience with \"Batman and Robin\" or \"The Shit Rap.\" The innocent honesty of an out- of-control drunken ex-cop Trailer Park Supervisor and his side-kick Randybobandy the cheeseburger eating ex male prostitute, weekend Trailer Park Supervisor is pants pissing humour at its warmest.\n\nThe show itself is roughly based on the T.V. series and movies, but being live, necessitates a different format and different is the operative word here.
