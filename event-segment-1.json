Performances are Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday-Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Ticket prices are $22 for adults, $20 for seniors, $17 for tickets on Thursday, with student tickets just $11 for any performance. Tickets are available online at www.a2ct.org, by calling the office at 734-971-2228, at the A2CT office at 322 W. Ann St., or at the door. Additional information is available by visiting www.a2ct.org.  \nThe archetypal villain, Iago, plots against his commander, the moor, Othello, using Othello\u2019s beautiful (and secret) wife, Desdemona, as the linchpin in his scheme. Shakespeare\u2019s tale of jealousy, revenge, and betrayal asks the question, what happens to the boundaries of good and evil as men and women are pushed to desperation in the midst of war?\nA2CT\u2019s upcoming production sets this tale of treachery and revenge against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, with its newly integrated armed services. Says director David Widmayer, \u201c[This setting] has helped me bring this show to life in a way I'm not sure I otherwise could. It's helpful both for the actors and for the audience to understand the context surrounding the play, and that's a very tall order when we're talking about an early seventeenth century English translation of a sixteenth century Italian story.\u201d He approaches the well-known classic with an eye toward the parallels to today, and the larger questions of nature versus nurture. \u201cIago and Othello don't do terrible things because they're terrible people, but because they've been deeply immersed in a culture which expects men to resort to violence first to solve their problems. The fact that we're still grappling with these issues as a culture centuries after Othello was written is staggering.\u201d\nThe talented cast is led by Justin Gordon as Othello, Ann Dilworth as Desdemona, Sean Sabo as Iago, and Carol Gray as Emilia. Joshua Kay, Greg Kovas, Trevor Maher, Matthew Miller, Maegan Murphy, Kaela Parnicky, Amanda Photenhauer, Russell Schwartz, Megan Shiplett, Tom Underwood, and Cierra Wollack round out a superbly strong ensemble", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/604827976308937/", "name": "Othello"}, {"date": "2016-10-28T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "There is no better storyteller than Chuck Brodsky.  Ranging from poignant to hilarious, his songs are about the little things in the lives of everyday people.  Chuck's soulful and compassionate voice brings his characters to life, and is the perfect instrument for infusing his lyrics with heartfelt humanity or biting wit. His spoken introductions to his songs can be as spellbinding as his colorful lyrics, which he brings to life with a well-travelled voice and a delivery that's natural and conversational. His groove-oriented strumming and fingerpicking draw on influences from the mountains of western North Carolina where he now lives, and from lots of different good old traditional folk stuff of all kinds. Chuck is widely known for his many wonderful songs about the heroes -- and zeroes -- of baseball. His latest CD is The Tell Tale Heart.\nwww.chuckbrodsky.com", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/147078752335941/", "name": "Chuck Brodsky at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"date": "2016-10-28T21:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "LIVE Ann Arbor is excited to announce the launch of the LIVE Festival Series.
