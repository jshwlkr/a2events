Our first chapter meeting of the year will be held at Wolverine Brewing at 7:00 p.m on Thursday, April 7th in the Gulo Room.  The address for Wolverine Brewing is: 2019 W Stadium Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. Location for future meetings are up in the air but we wanted to patronize Wolverine a bit more because of the incredible support they've given us the last couple of years.  We also want to be sensitive to some of the concerns we've heard about the location of the meeting in the past.  Wolverine gives us a slightly more centralized location to our geographically diverse membership and is very close to the highway.  \n\nAt this meeting we'll be discussing the status of and plans for Waterloo, of course.  We'll also give updates on new events (Brecfest, the Tri Chapter Challenge and Youth Riding Day) as well as talk about the 2016 schedule for all of our traditional events.  If you attend you'll be able to hear the latest about the new IMBA Associate Regional Director for Michigan and how this person will be focusing on advocacy for mountain biking across the state.  And, as usual, we'll give a quick overview of the status of the trails, talk about scheduled trail days and other plans for maintenance this year.\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nThe Poto Chapter Board", "name": "Poto Chapter Meeting"}, {"date": "2016-04-07T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/970118143072822/", "description": "Bryan Burrough is a special correspondent at Vanity Fair magazine and the author of six books, including the No. 1 New York Times Best-Seller Barbarians at the Gate and his latest, Days of Rage. He is also a three-time winner of the prestigious Gerald Loeb Award for Excellence in Financial Journalism.\nBorn in 1961, Bryan was raised in Temple, Texas, and graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1983. From 1983 to 1992 he was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, where he reported from Dallas, Houston, Pittsburgh and, during the late 1980s, covered the busy mergers and acquisitions beat in New York. He has written for Vanity Fair since 1992.\nIn 1990 Bryan and John Helyar co-authored Barbarians, the story of the fight for control of RJR Nabisco. The book, which spent 39 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has been hailed as one of the most influential business narratives of all time. Bryan joined Vanity Fair in 1992, where he has reported from locales as diverse as Hollywood, Nepal, Moscow, Tokyo and Jerusalem.\n\nFrom the bestselling author of Public Enemies and The Big Rich, an explosive account of the decade-long battle between the FBI and the homegrown revolutionary terrorists of the 1970s\nThe Weathermen. The Symbionese Liberation Army. The FALN. The Black Liberation Army. The names seem quaint now, when not forgotten altogether. But there was a stretch of time in America, roughly between 1968 and 1975, when there was on average more than one significant terrorist act in this country every week, and the FBI combated these groups and others as nodes in a single revolutionary underground, dedicated to the violent overthrow of the American government.\n\nBenefiting from the extraordinary number of people from the underground and the FBI who speak about their experiences for the first time, Days of Rage is filled with important revelations and fresh details about the major revolutionaries and their connections and about the FBI and its desperate efforts to make the bombings stop. The result is mesmerizing and completely new\u2014a book that takes us into the hearts and minds of homegrown terrorists and federal agents alike and weaves their stories into a spellbinding secret history of the 1970s.", "name": "Meet Author & Journalist Bryan Burrough for a Discussion of 'Days of Rage'"}, {"date": "2016-04-08T12:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1690979864475279/", "description": "Can't Make it to the city to celebrate Opening Day?\n\nJoin us on the patio at babo to cheer in the season! \n\nBringing the ballpark to you!\nWe'll be broadcasting the game live on the patio, grilling up game day favorites (See Menu below), and quenching your thirst all day long with happy hour pricing on beer, wine, and sangria.\n\nDon't be left in the outfield! \nMake Opening Day a home run for you and all your friends.\n\nNo Tickets Needed!\n\nGAMEDAY MENU\n\n$12.50\nEnjoy one item from the grill, unlimited toppings, and 2 sides! \n\nFROM THE GRILL\n\nBabo Burgers on brioche\nBlack bean Burgers (V) on brioche\n\nAll Beef Hotdogs \nItalian Sausage\n\nCONDIMENTS\n\nNew York white cheddar, Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, roasted mushrooms, roasted poblano peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, house pickles, dijon mustard, whole grain mustard, garlic aioli, basil ketchup, house pickle relish or chipotle aioli.\n\nCHOICE OF 2 SIDES\n\nPear and Kale Salad\nParsnip Slaw\nGerman Potato Salad\nAvocado Slaw\nMacaroni and Cheese", "name": "Opening Day at Babo"}, {"date": "2016-04-08T14:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1111017545627223/", "name": "Chilean Wine tasting"}, {"date": "2016-04-08T17:30:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1586066655048953/", "description": "A Night OUT is a social mixer for the LGBTQ* community at Necto Nightclub.

Seeley Professor of English at Allegheny College. He is the author of the poetry collections After Greece and Goat Funeral. He is also co-translator of The Lions\u2019 Gate: Selected Poems of Titos Patrikios, and the author of Honey, Olives, Octopus: Adventures at the Greek Table. Of Eternity & Oranges, Adam Zagajewski says: \u201cThis is a beautiful collection of poems: half-cryptic, half-open; half based on ancient myths, half on actual life. There\u2019s almost always Greece as the backdrop, olives and the sea but also a human drama. Christopher Bakken proves that what\u2019s ancient is also modern and vice versa. We live between times; only poetry can make it palpable.\u201d\n\nDavid Blair is the author of two previous poetry collections. He teaches at the New England Institute of Art. Another book, Arsonville, is forthcoming. Of his most recent work, Friends with Dogs, Tom Sleigh says: \u201cWhat gives weight and density to David Blair\u2019s remarkable poems is their almost Hardyish sense of regret and loss. So many of his poems are little dramas of what wasn\u2019t said when it should have been said, or of the way celebratory instincts get undermined by the pressures of day-to-day life. I admire the quick shifts in voicing, the way a whole social world becomes revealed in some small characteristic gesture, and how alert Blair is to other people. Very few poets ever achieve this kind of fellow feeling and write about it with such tact and intelligent sympathy.\u201d\n\nCody Walker is the author of Shuffle and Breakdown and the co-editor of Alive at the Center: Contemporary Poems from the Pacific Northwest. His poems have appeared in The Yale Review, Parnassus, Slate, Poetry Northwest, The Hecht Prize Anthology, and the 2007 and 2015 editions of The Best American Poetry; his essays have appeared online in The New Yorker and The Kenyon Review. He lives with his family in Ann Arbor, where he teaches English at the University of Michigan. Of his latest, Mary Jo Salter says: \u201cIn Cody Walker\u2019s The Self-Styled No-Child, the poet-father sings to his new baby (read \u2018Cradle Song\u2019 or \u2018Small Suite\u2019 for perfect little servings of delight), but his childlike playfulness has an internal source, too. The light verses in Walker\u2019s new collection often have dark edges to them (see \u2018The Garden\u2019 or \u2018We Hated Our Lives\u2019), and his social and political satires are unflinching. Still, this word-wizard with a genius for rhyme reminds us of how irrepressibly joy remains.\u201d", "name": "Poetry at Literati: Christopher Bakken, David Blair, & Cody Walker"}]
