At 8% ABV, Terminator topped the list as our highest gravity beer for years. Our winter lager is perhaps our most famous beer, though no longer the strongest. Like all traditional German Dopplebocks it is richly spicy with a subtly sweet malt palate and a clean, crisp, dry hop finish.\n\nABC is continuing our commitment to Terminate Hunger in Washtenaw County with our partnership with The Breakfast at St. Andrew's. $1 from each Terminator sold will be donated to the the Breakfast at St. Andrew's.\n\nLaunched in 1982 by a handful of volunteers, today, the Breakfast at St. Andrew's serves between 90 and 150 meals daily. More than 100 volunteers, donate their time on a regular basis. Every morning from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m., the welcome guests who come for a hot meal and to pack a sandwich lunch for later in the day. Guests include the young and old. They arrive as individuals or in groups. Some are homeless or struggling with addiction or mental illness, but most are working men and women who are trying to make ends meet in a difficult economy. As a non-profit organization, the Breakfast at St. Andrew's is the only program in the Ann Arbor community serving a meal without charge, every day at the same time and place. http://breakfastatstandrews.org/about-us.htm\n\nLive music graciously provided by Ryan Racine.\nIt's been a twenty-plus year journey for Ryan Racine to get to where his music finds itself. Recording for the first time as a solo artist and writing without what he refers to as \"the shackles of genre\", the direction is really a culmination of the variety in his past projects. The sound is still very much grounded in American Roots music but is unbound by the narrow concepts he has applied to previous outings. www.ryanracine.com\n\nThis event is open to the public and donations are encouraged."}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/353747608350722/", "name": "Aventura Ann Arbor 3 Year Anniversary Celebration", "date": "2016-11-23T17:00:00-05:00", "description": "Join us Wednesday, November 23rd from 5pm\u201312am, to celebrate our 3 year anniversary!
