Drawing from her background in Irish dance, and influenced by a diverse musical range from classical to Cape Breton, Aislinn\u2019s distinct style shines through her music in an open and honest way. Known for her syncopated and rhythmic accompaniment, her compositions and arrangements offer a fresh perspective to the Irish music tradition.\n\nRaised immersed in the Irish culture (the shared heritage on both sides of her family) Aislinn learned about Irish customs through dance, music and language lessons. She was drawn to the harp from an early age, and studied with various Irish and Celtic harpers including Janet Harbison and Michael Rooney. Aislinn also spent a semester abroad at the University of Limerick where she worked closely with Irish harper Fionnuala Rooney.\n\nAislinn\u2019s recently released debut solo harp album The Thin Place has been called \u201cstunning, a monumental piece of work from a very talented and driven harper\u201d and \u201cfor a first CD it\u2019s a winner\u201d (Jack Baker of Irish American News). The album blends popular traditional Irish tunes with those less commonly played, and features four of her own compositions including one with the album\u2019s namesake. Joining Aislinn on select tracks are some of Chicago\u2019s finest Irish musicians: Liz Carroll (fiddle), Teresa Shine (fiddle) and John Williams (concertina). Aislinn\u2019s tune The Thin Place and accompanying track is also featured on the Irish Traditional Music Archive\u2019s Newly Composed Tunes and Songs in the Irish Tradition playlist. Listen to a sample here.\n\nFrom performing annually at Irish festivals including the Milwaukee Irish Fest, to private events and traditional Irish music sessions, Aislinn is in high-demand as a performer and keeps a busy schedule. She is a featured musician for the annual iBAM! (Irish Books Arts & Music) Gala Dinner, and played for celebrations honoring the opening of the Ireland: Crossroads of Art & Design, 1690-1840 exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAislinn holds a B.F.A. in Inter-Arts (music and dance), an interdisciplinary major in Ethnic Studies and a certificate in Celtic Studies. She has taught workshops at the Milwaukee Irish Fest School of Music (MIFSM), the Milwaukee Irish Fest Summer School, the Great Lakes Harpers (GLH) Regional Conference, and the Madison Folk Harp Society. Currently Aislinn teaches from her private studio in Chicago and via Skype, is on faculty at the MIFSM, and teaches workshops at the Old Town School of Folk Music.\n\nVisit Aislinn on the web at www.aislinnmusic.com\n\nThis project is partially supported by an Individual Artist Program Grant from the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs & Special Events, as well as a grant from the Illinois Arts Council, a state agency through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-25T17:30:00-04:00", "name": "Aislinn Gagliardi- Irish Harp Concert"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1048254868623346/", "description": "Join us for the next installment of Friends of babo on Sunday, September 25th at 6pm.

In this propulsive, masterfully plotted epic, an urban wasteland whose history is plagued with riots and unrest is reimagined as an ambiguous new frontier\u2014a site of tenacity, possibility, even hope. Driven by struggle and suspense, and shot through with a startling empathy, Christopher Hebert\u2019s magnificent second novel unspools an American story for our time.\n\n\u201cA humbler, more endearing bunch of rainbow-hued misfits never fumbled their broken-hearted way towards revolution than those we meet in Christopher Hebert\u2019s Angels of Detroit\u2013truly a novel of our moment, both in the way it stares unsentimentally at the real trouble we are in\u2013a world of poisoned children and cities in ruins\u2013and in the deep and detailed empathy it shows for characters of every class and provenance. Hebert gets Detroit right, in this beautifully made book: his careful drawing of its physical catastrophe locates the city at the exact boundary between gritty-real and surreal, between last hope and post-apocalyptic nightmare.\u201d\u2014Jaimy Gordon, author of the National Book Award-winning Lord of Misrule\n\nChristopher Hebert is the author of the novels Angels of Detroit and The Boiling Season, winner of the 2013 Friends of American Writers award. He is also co-editor of Stories of Nation: Fictions, Politics, and the American Experience (forthcoming from UT Press). His short fiction and nonfiction have appeared in such publications as FiveChapters, Cimarron Review, Narrative, Interview, and the Millions.

Currently he lives in Knoxville, TN, where he is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Tennessee.\n\n*\n\nMargaret Lazarus Dean's Leaving Orbit: Notes from the Last Days of American Spaceflight won the Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize. In the 1960s, humans took their first steps away from the earth, and for a time our possibilities in space seemed endless. But in a period of austerity and in the wake of high-profile disasters like Challenger, that dream has ended. In early 2011, Margaret Lazarus Dean traveled to Cape Canaveral for NASA\u2019s last three space shuttle launches in order to bear witness to the end of an era. With Dean as our guide to Florida\u2019s Space Coast and to the history of NASA, Leaving Orbit takes the measure of what American spaceflight has achieved while reckoning with its earlier witnesses like Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, and Oriana Fallaci. Along the way Dean meets NASA workers, astronauts, and space fans, gathering possible answers to the question: what does it mean that a spacefaring nation won\u2019t be going to space anymore?\n\n\u201cMargaret Lazarus Dean is that rarest of hybrids, the dearest of hyphenates. She brings to science such exquisite sentence making, to futurism the sound anchorage of the past, to space travel the tidings of personal journey. Journalist, essayist, memoirist and storyteller\u2014her prized text shows Americans, each and every, how we came to be the ones we are. And where we\u2019re going. This is rocket science, reliable witness, replete with poetry.\u201d\u2014Thomas Lynch, author of The Undertaking\n\nMargaret Lazarus Dean received a BA in anthropology from Wellesley College and an MFA from the University of Michigan. She is the author of the novel The Time It Takes to Fall and the recipient of fellowships from the NEA and the Tennessee Arts Commission. She is an associate professor of English at the University of Tennessee.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-26T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Margaret Lazarus Dean & Christopher Hebert"}]
