[{"description": "Literati is pleased to welcome Scott Ellsworth in support of The Secret Game: A Wartime Story of Courage, Change, and Basketball's Lost Triumph.\n\nThe Secret Game is the true story of the game that never should have happened--and of a nation on the brink of monumental change. In the fall of 1943, at the little-known North Carolina College for Negroes, Coach John McLendon was on the verge of changing basketball forever. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of James Naismith, the game's inventor, McLendon taught his team to play the full-court press and run a fast break that no one could catch. His Eagles would become the highest-scoring college team in America--a basketball juggernaut that shattered its opponents by as many as sixty points per game. Yet his players faced danger whenever they traveled backcountry roads.\n\nAcross town, at Duke University, the best basketball squad on campus wasn't the Blue Devils, but an all-white military team from the Duke medical school. Composed of former college stars from across the country, the team dismantled everyone they faced, including the Duke varsity. They were prepared to take on anyone--until an audacious invitation arrived, one that was years ahead of anything the South had ever seen before. What happened next wasn't on anyone's schedule. \n\nBased on years of research, The Secret Game is a story of courage and determination, and of an incredible, long-buried moment in the nation's sporting past. The riveting, true account of a remarkable season, it is the story of how a group of forgotten college basketball players, aided by a pair of refugees from Nazi Germany and a group of daring student activists, not only blazed a trail for a new kind of America, but helped create one of the most meaningful moments in basketball history.\n\nScott Ellsworth has written about American history for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. Formerly a historian at the Smithsonian Institution, he is the author of Death in a Promised Land, a groundbreaking account of the 1921 Tulsa race riot. He lives with his wife and twin sons in Ann Arbor, where he teaches at the University of Michigan.", "name": "Scott Ellsworth", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1575967599393425/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-03-28T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"description": "Get ready for the largest expansion of bus service since 1979!\n\nOrganizations are welcome to send front-line staff to learn how to assist clients with bus service information.\n\nThe May, 2016 service expansion will be the biggest in TheRide's history...creating more ways to connect with jobs, school, appointments, shopping and family and friends. \n\n\"Get Ready!\" for:\n*More routes to serve more places\n*More frequent service\n*More direct routes in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti\n*New route names and numbers\n*New service to Scio Township\n*New service in Pittsfield Township\n\nVisit http://TheRideYourWay.org/ for more information on the improvements coming on May 1st!", "name": "TheRide\u2019s ServiceFest", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/181952312183242/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-03-29T10:00:00-04:00"}, {"description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n-      March 29 - Dave Menzo\nhttp://www.davemenzo.com/\nDave Menzo is a solo artist who has the pleasure of playing with a few bands and many talented musicians.\n\nAPRIL\n\n-          April 5 - Bob Skon \nhttp://bobskon.com/\n\"Bob is a musician best described in the singer / songwriter style, blended with a healthy dose of folk-rock, and a touch of jazz....

Each year, on a rotating basis, the Ann Arbor Art Center presents a media-focused exhibition as part of the series. We are pleased to present this year's exhibit which features innovative work in photography.\n\nContemporary photography in America is at an exciting and transitory moment. Since the advent of digital photography, the medium has continued to shapeshift into an increasingly inclusive art form. It has been estimated that around 1.4 billion photographs are taken every day, and even more \u201cphotographs\u201d can be created by using scanners or creating photographic elements in digital software.\nSome photographic artists continue to use photography in traditional ways: to capture and record the actual world. From the most news-worthy events to the smallest domestic moments, the strength of these images is reliant on the perceptiveness and timeliness of the photographers making them. Other photographic artists create complicated digital collages that bear many similarities to painting. By removing the necessity of photography to show the thing itself, these artists can create constructed scenes within a photograph that never existed in the physical world. To complicate the medium further, the last several decades have produced a resurgence of photographs created through historic processes like cyanotype and wet collodian. Defining what photography is and what a photograph looks like has never been more challenging.\n\nWhile the world is currently experiencing an overflow of photographic images, what makes a photograph successful has stayed relatively unchanged. ART NOW: PHOTOGRAPHY highlights photographic artists that are able to use the world as a raw material to communicate their own visions and experiences. While the processes may vary significantly, this exhibition highlights innovative artists working in photography whose practices shapes what Photography is in 2016.\n-----------\nThe 117 Gallery 2015/2016 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC", "name": "ART NOW 2016: New Directions in Contemporary Photography: Exhibition Opening", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1716244898615592/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-04-01T18:00:00-04:00"}]
