Each year, on a rotating basis, the Ann Arbor Art Center presents a media-focused exhibition as part of the series. We are pleased to present this year's exhibit which features innovative work in photography.\n\nContemporary photography in America is at an exciting and transitory moment. Since the advent of digital photography, the medium has continued to shapeshift into an increasingly inclusive art form. It has been estimated that around 1.4 billion photographs are taken every day, and even more \u201cphotographs\u201d can be created by using scanners or creating photographic elements in digital software.\nSome photographic artists continue to use photography in traditional ways: to capture and record the actual world. From the most news-worthy events to the smallest domestic moments, the strength of these images is reliant on the perceptiveness and timeliness of the photographers making them. Other photographic artists create complicated digital collages that bear many similarities to painting. By removing the necessity of photography to show the thing itself, these artists can create constructed scenes within a photograph that never existed in the physical world. To complicate the medium further, the last several decades have produced a resurgence of photographs created through historic processes like cyanotype and wet collodian. Defining what photography is and what a photograph looks like has never been more challenging.\n\nWhile the world is currently experiencing an overflow of photographic images, what makes a photograph successful has stayed relatively unchanged. ART NOW: PHOTOGRAPHY highlights photographic artists that are able to use the world as a raw material to communicate their own visions and experiences. While the processes may vary significantly, this exhibition highlights innovative artists working in photography whose practices shapes what Photography is in 2016.\n-----------\nThe 117 Gallery 2015/2016 season is supported by Vintage Financial Services LLC", "date": "2016-04-01T18:00:00-04:00", "name": "ART NOW 2016: New Directions in Contemporary Photography: Exhibition Opening", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1716244898615592/"}, {"description": "Sponsored by the University of Michigan Credit Union, Arts & Eats: Dig In with UMS is a $15 ticket package deal that includes a great seat at the performance, exclusive access to a pre-show dinner, and a fun activity to get you thinking about the performance in a whole new way.

No other mariachi in history has had a trajectory or influence remotely comparable to theirs; they are widely considered the finest mariachi in the world. Founded in a small city near Jalisco by Don Gaspar Vargas in the 1890s, this band basically invented the modern mariachi. With world-class vocalists and instrumentalists, flawless ensemble work, impeccable taste in repertoire, and spellbinding showmanship, the group never fails to engage its audience, eliciting spontaneous gritos, sing-alongs, and one ovation after another with their heart-wrenching vocals and virtuosic instrumentals. Masters at melding the old world style of mariachi music with new, innovative pieces, Mariachi Vargas is appealing to audiences across all generations. \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/1516-mariachi-vargas-de-tecalitlan", "date": "2016-04-01T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/453190221522442/"}, {"description": "In a career that spans 23 albums and includes three Grammy awards, Tom Chapin has covered a lot of creative ground. In addition to his work as a recording artist and concert performer, Chapin has acted on Broadway and worked in films, television and radio. Tom grew up in a family that encouraged artistic pursuits. He began performing professionally as a teenager in the early 1960s, playing in Greenwich Village folk clubs alongside his siblings, Harry and Steve, as one of The Chapin Brothers. In 1971, he began a five-year run as the host of the ABC-TV children's series, \"Make A Wish.\" Chapin and his songs were also featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Blue Water, White Death,\" for which he spent six months sailing the Indian Ocean searching for great white sharks.\n\nAs a music-maker, Chapin has maintained two parallel careers, as a highly respected contemporary folk artist and as a pioneer in the field of children's music. In the former role, Chapin has established a reputation for insightful, heartfelt songcraft and charismatic live performances. In the latter, he continues to engage the hearts, minds and imaginations of young listeners with witty, life-affirming original songs delivered in a sophisticated array of musical styles. Chapin's infectious songs, sterling musicianship and personal warmth shine, whether he's performing on record or in a concert hall, an outdoor festival, a school, in front of a symphony orchestra, or in an intimate coffeehouse. www.tomchapin.com", "date": "2016-04-01T20:00:00-04:00", "name": "Tom Chapin at  Green Wood Coffee House", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1713063788906616/"}, {"description": "FRESH + FIT!\nStarting April 1, babo and FitPoint  want to help you optimize your diet and fitness.
