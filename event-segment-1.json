[{"description": "Featuring the newly released Zingerman\u2019s Guide to Good Leading, Part 4; A Lapsed Anarchist\u2019s Approach to the Power of Beliefs in Business (a copy of the book is included in the price of each seat.)\n\nAlthough most of us don\u2019t realize it, our beliefs have a major impact on how things go in our lives. What we believe may or may not be true, but unknowingly most of us will behave in ways that reinforce our beliefs anyways. At this breakfast, Ari Weinzweig, Co-Founder and CEO of Zingerman\u2019s Community of Businesses, will take a look at how the impact of those beliefs likely play out in our day to day experiences in the workplace, and how we and our workplaces are impacted by those beliefs. Whether we accept it or not, what we believe about ourselves, about our organization, our co-workers, our boss, the work that we do and our ability to do it will significantly alter the outcomes we are seeking to achieve. And how, by becoming more mindful of our beliefs, we can effectively backtrack\u2014by altering our beliefs, we change the way we see our work and the world and then, in turn, significantly alter the outcomes we get from our efforts.\n\nIt is our belief you will leave breakfast with a full stomach and a full mind - with new insights, tips and techniques into how you can become more mindful of your own beliefs and how you can positively affect your surroundings by changing your beliefs.\n\nBreakfast is served!\n- Fresh Fruit Platter\n- Zingerman\u2019s Bakehouse Coffee Cakes\n- Corned Beef Hash\n- Applewood Smoked Bacon\n- Zingerman\u2019s Coffee Co.

Fascinated by the simple aesthetic, the craftsmanship, and the makers\u2019 unassuming personalities and ways of life, Holmes visited many kiln towns to photograph and interview the artists and collect ceramic wares of various shapes and techniques. She donated a significant portion of her collection to UMMA in 2013.\n\nRichly introduced in this presentation are works by ceramic artists emerging in the late 1960s and the early 1970s in the town of Mashiko, two hours north of Tokyo by train. Mashiko became an international mecca of folk ceramics after Hamada Sh\u014dji (1894\u20131978), a major figure of Japan\u2019s Folk Craft (Mingei) Movement, set up his studio there in 1930. Hamada\u2019s idea of ceramic making for a new age, which combined the aesthetic of folk ceramics and the modern concept of the studio artist, attracted many younger artists of unconventional backgrounds, including women.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/170729440003602/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-08-12T11:00:00-04:00", "name": "In Focus: Modern Japanese Folk Ceramics"}, {"description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/626712344171582/", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-08-12T15:00:00-04:00", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe"}, {"description": "Come join us for a reunion jazz benefit concert sponsored by The Morning Owl Cafe in Milan, MI.
