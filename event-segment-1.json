[{"description": "Are you looking for a place to meet other trans folks in and around the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area? T-Time is a social gathering and safe space by trans people for trans people of all ages.\n\nStarting the 4th Monday in January 2017, we'll be at Cultivate every month on the 4th Monday from 6-8 PM. The table will be reserved with a sign that reads \"T-Time.\"\n\nAll trans, genderqueer, and questioning people are welcome in this space. FTM, MTF, agender, genderqueer, and any other trans identities are welcome! Minors are welcome to attend with or without a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians are welcome to stay with their child if needed. \n\nWe'll be drinking coffee, tea, and beer (for those 21+). The space can be used however you want - board games, networking, or simply just hanging out. Cultivate offers some board games. They even welcome outside food!\n\nAt least one FTM A2 Ypsi representative will be in attendance at every T-Time. If you need resources, have questions to ask, or need someone to talk to, please do so with one of the representatives and not a participant unless they say otherwise. Trans people are often forced to educate others, even when they don't feel comfortable, so we don't want anyone to be placed in that kind of position.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/207251706412069/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "T-Time", "date": "2017-01-23T18:00:00-05:00"}, {"description": "Art Off The Wall 2016 is the Ann Arbor Art Center's BIGGEST Holiday Exhibition and Shopping Event ever!
