The Ensemble is a great place for both new and experienced improvisers to form brand new troupes of enthusiastic actors who will spend a year developing their improv skills and performing together. Our previous troupes have performed around southeast Michigan, and former CIE members have been cast at Pointless Brewery & Theatre, Planet Ant Theatre, and Go Comedy! Improv Theater.\n\nAuditions will take place at the A2CT Studio (322 W. Ann St, Ann Arbor) on Saturday, January 28 from 6:00-9:00, and Sunday, January 29 from 3:00-6:00. Auditioners must be at least 18 years old, and need attend only one of the two audition days, but should plan to stay the entire time if possible. No pre-registration is required - please arrive a few minutes early to fill out an audition form.\n\nCallbacks for the long-form troupe only will take place Monday, January 30 from 7:00-10:00 at Brain Trainers (2900 S State St, Ann Arbor).\n\nNo preparation or previous experience is required for auditions, which will consist of a variety of short improv games and some basic two-person scene work. We are looking for actors with good energy, a willingness to take chances, and the ability to listen closely on stage and react honestly. Please wear comfortable clothes and be prepared to move. The only fee for Civic Improv is the standard membership fee for all A2CT actors - $25 per year.\n\nEach of our three coaches is looking to cast a troupe of 6 to 12 actors. The three troupes will be:\n\nShort-Form Troupe - coached by Shelly Smith\nThis troupe will focus on short-form games like those featured on Whose Line Is It Anyway or at ComedySportz. This is a great place for those brand new to improv to start out, as well as quick-witted quipsters and anyone who's a fan of fun.\n\nMid-Form Troupe - coached by Jen Delisi\nLearn to create longer scene-based stories in this troupe. Jen introduces improvisers to a variety of tools for bridging the gap between short-form games and long-form scene work. With a clap of their hands, your fellow improvisers will send your characters to unusual locations and hilarious new situations.\n\nLong-Form Troupe - coached by David Widmayer\nScene work is the core of long-form improv - improvisers will learn to walk onto a blank stage with nothing but a simple suggestion and create unique, complex characters and a whole world for them to inhabit. This troupe will be introduced to a variety of scenic forms, and ultimately choose and develop a signature format to bring to their performances.\n\nPlease email David Widmayer (djwidmayer@gmail.com) with any questions.", "name": "Civic Improv Auditions!"}, {"date": "2017-01-28T20:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/195810100885174/", "description": "Celebrating 15 years of the annual gala tradition - wine included!\n\nThis year Kerrytown Concert House is pulling out all the stops (and wine bottle corks!) for WWS XV!

January 28 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nHiss Golden Messenger\nThe writing of the songs that became Heart Like a Levee started in a hotel room in Washington, DC , in January of 2015 during a powerful storm that darkened the East Coast. At that time I was feeling-more acutely than I had ever felt before-wrenched apart by my responsibilities to my family and to my music. Forgetting, momentarily, that for me, each exists only with the other. How could I forget? Though maybe my lapse was reasonable: I had just quit my job, the most recent and last, in a series of deadend gigs stretching back 20 years, with the vow that my children would understand their father as a man in love with his world and the inventor of his own days. They would be rare in that regard. And then-driven by monthly bills and pure fear- I left for another tour, carrying a load of guilt that I could just barely lift. But in that snowy hotel room I found the refrain that became my compass: I was a dreamer, babe, when I set out on the road; but did I say I could find my way home?\n\nWSG: Scott Hirsch\n\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?eventId=7026525&pl=blindpig&dispatch=loadSelectionData", "name": "Hiss Golden Messenger 1/28/17 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"date": "2017-01-29T00:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/388503011499248/", "description": "COLD-PRESSED JUICE CLEANSES ARE BACK!\n\n... and just in time for the New Year!
