We seek to explore the generational, ethnographic, cultural, and anthropological ideals of what the word American means. From fresh apple pie to Budweiser, the Star Spangled Banner to Party in the USA, what is the modern American experience? Are we entering the sci-fi World of Tomorrow, longing for the Norman Rockwell past, or painting ourselves into an Idiocracy? If our culture is our biggest export, what kind of image are we presenting to the world? \n\nJuror: Peter Baker\nPeter Baker is an Ann Arbor-based photographer who specializes in editorial, travel, and advertising photography.

A favorite at blues festivals in Michigan and Canada, they call their Detroit blues \u201cvery greasy, grimy, and lowdown\u201d\u2014a sound that arrived from the Delta Blues regions with the northern migration for factory jobs during Detroit's industrial revolution. With a recipe that comes from the legendary harmonica bands of Little Walter, Jerry Portnoy, Junior Wells, Paul Butterfield, and Sonny Boy Williamson (sr. and jr.), this is energetic and spontaneous blues that will get fans at TOP shuffling their feet.\nWebsite: http://www.theboaconstrictors.com/", "name": "The Boa Constrictors", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1019028304840040/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-07-01T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Singer Mayer Hawthorne has an incredible ear for what makes music soulful. \u201cFlashy but classy\u201d and always stylish in a fine suit, he\u2019s a sensation onstage.

Lauded for their bold and intricate compositions, the group often draws comparisons to Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. The band\u2019s original music combines strict notation with moments of improvisation and maintains a healthy balance of dark and heavy rock grooves with quirky jazz obscurities. While Lovely Socialite\u2019s unusual mix of strings, traditional Chinese instruments, brass, and a jazz rhythm section suggest that the group might be a contemporary music ensemble, it is their use of stomp boxes, vocal processors, and other electronics that makes the group a suitable fit for any rock, hip-hop, or jazz bill. In fact, Lovely Socialite has been privileged to share the stage with such artists as Dessa, of Minneapolis hip-hop collective Doomtree, as well as performing live on the UW Madison Terrace with Brian Ritchie of the Violent Femmes. \n\nBen Willis, double bass/electronics\nPat Reinholz, electric cello/electronics\nBrian Grimm, pipa/gaohu/guzheng/ cello/electronics\nCorey Murphy, trombone/electronics\nAbe Sorber, vibraphone/drums\nMike Koszewski, drums/percussion\n\nOrn\u00e2matik captivates audiences with an energetic and unique take on Eastern European folk music.
