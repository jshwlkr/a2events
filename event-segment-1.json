Even if you are thinking about it, you can click \"Interested\" so you can get updates on this page. Do this by 4:00pm, the day of the show. This does not guarantee you a spot, but not doing it puts you at the bottom of the list.\n- After 4:00pm Sunday, \"show ups\" can \"go up\" only if spots are available.\n- The line-up will be created just before showtime.\n- Those arriving after the line-up is finalized will be given spots as time permits.\n- Length of stage time will depend largely on the turn out, performer's experience, and the show-runner's discretion.\n- As always, if you show up and do not get a spot, you will be put at the top of the list for the next show.\n- Please refrain from bringing alcohol. Beer and wine will be available for purchase. You will need to buy a membership to drink, $2 for the day, or $10 for the whole year. Layout will be basically what we had before in Ypsi, boxes and cans with a container for money. \n\n--- Want to increase your odds of getting a spot? Here's some DO's and DON'T's\nDO . . . . Share this event page with your fans on your fan page, your facebook page, your website, or your tweets, or any other social media.\nDO . . . . Volunteer for less time. If you are willing to do 3 rather than 5, or 4 rather than 7, then you are more likely to get a spot.\nDO . . . . Come to the paid shows.\nDO . . . . Stay for \"meet and greet\" after shows.\nDO . . . . Answer poll questions whenever they appear on the event page.\nDO . . . . Bring people. This is not, I repeat NOT, a \"bringer.\" But if somebody has come to see you, it will be very hard to deny you a spot. In the past, we've had shows where we've added a minute of time for every person the comic brought as a non-performing audience member. Bring three people and a five minute spot becomes an eight minute spot.\n\nContact Mark at: www.facebook.com/marksweetman\n\nChili Challis, former staff writer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and nationally known comedian, writer and teacher says about The UNclub,\n\n\"The ... UNclub IS as close to a pure artist's way of pursuing, grasping and understanding comedy as I have ever known; not to mention it's open and fair to every talent, EVERY talent, even ones right off the street. Comics are allowed to go 'out there' and they're permitted to fail and still be welcomed back. It doesn't get any better than that as far as I'm concerned, and I've been known to be a bit fussy. This special venue is poised for the big wave, it is so ready and worthy of being discovered by an audience...and when they do it will be pure addiction.\"\ufeff", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/300255827017458/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "The UNclub at the Madhouse, October 2, 2016"}, {"date": "2016-10-03T09:00:00-04:00", "description": "Maker Works\u2019 Makerspace Operations Bootcamp puts you in the middle of an established makerspace for a five-day inspiring deep-dive into the tools for running a sustainable makerspace.

Recording for the first time as a solo artist and writing without what he refers to as \"the shackles of genre\", the direction is really a culmination of the variety in his past projects. The sound is still very much grounded in American Roots music but is unbound by the narrow concepts he has applied to previous outings. \n\nRyan Racine first made a name for himself as the front man of Ann Arbor\u2019s rockabilly outfit Lucky Haskins. Formed when he was only 15, the band burst onto the metro Detroit rockabilly scene and quickly garnered attention and a loyal fan base. Besides introducing the genre to a whole new generation in the area, they earned spots opening for legends like Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Lee Rocker as well as a slot in the 1995 Detroit Music Awards.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/176158106121056/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Ryan Racine"}]
