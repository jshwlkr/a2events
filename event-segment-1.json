From the very beginning, they felt this place should be more than just a hangout; that is could be a safe place to make new friends, mix with youth from different backgrounds, explore new ideas, learn new skills and do it all in a setting that was teen friendly and teen driven. Teens wrote the mission statement and the first grant proposal to the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation and, with seed money in hand, enlisted parents and friends to turn an old brick and timber warehouse into a teen center."}, {"date": "2016-05-13T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/494032960807144/", "name": "Pointless Improv with MATCH and Adultery", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers.\n\nGroup 1: \"MATCH\" starring Matt Pendrige and Mitch Socia \n\nGroup 2: \"Adultery\" starring Aaron Johnstone, Nuverre Naami, Lorin Kozlowski\n\nGroup 3: \"The League of Pointless Improvisers\" starring Aaron Johnstone, Corene Ford, Moni Jones, Maggie O'Reilly, Mitch Socia"}, {"date": "2016-05-13T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1637106023218709/", "name": "Harmony Bones at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "\"Harmony Bones\" is a quintet of long-time veterans of the Ann Arbor folk music scene.
