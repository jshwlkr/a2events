This time around, we\u2019re talking about what medical diagnostic tests can (and cannot) tell us, sustainable living in a solar-powered house made of straw, and how time is dumb - we\u2019re looking at you, Daylight Saving Time!\n\nTesting, testing! NNA2 alum and PhD/MD student Carl Engelke is here to talk about medical testing - the how, the why, and the reality of what some of these common screening exams can and can\u2019t tell us. Science!\n\nHay is for houses! Professor, designer, and farmer Joe Trumpey built his house out of straw and field rocks and determination and ingenuity, and he\u2019s here to tell you the practical side of transitioning to an off-the-grid, sustainable lifestyle.\n\n(H)our third speaker is engineer Matt Carpenter - he\u2019ll take a moment to explain the stories behind leap years and the agony and ecstasy that is falling back and springing forward with Daylight Saving Time. \n\nSo text the friend you\u2019ve been meaning to hang out with and come see us for Tests, Transition, & Time: How to save lives, energy, and daylight at LIVE on First St, Thursday, 3/23, doors at 6:30 pm.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/209961842816480/", "name": "NNA2 #43: Tests, Transition, & Time"}, {"date": "2017-03-23T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Literati is thrilled to welcome Lindy West in celebration of the paperback release of her memoir, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman, a New York Times bestseller, winner of the 2016 Stranger Genius Award for Literature, and a staff pick here at Literati.\n\nShrill is an uproarious memoir, a feminist rallying cry in a world that thinks gender politics are tedious and that women, especially feminists, can't be funny. Coming of age in a culture that demands women be as small, quiet, and compliant as possible--like a porcelain dove that will also have sex with you--writer and humorist Lindy West quickly discovered that she was anything but. From a painfully shy childhood in which she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her big body and even bigger opinions; to her public war with stand-up comedians over rape jokes; to her struggle to convince herself, and then the world, that fat people have value; to her accidental activism and never-ending battle royale with Internet trolls, Lindy narrates her life with a blend of humor and pathos that manages to make a trip to the abortion clinic funny and wring tears out of a story about diarrhea.\n\nWith inimitable good humor, vulnerability, and boundless charm, Lindy boldly shares how to survive in a world where not all stories are created equal and not all bodies are treated with equal respect, and how to weather hatred, loneliness, harassment, and loss, and walk away laughing. Shrill provocatively dissects what it means to become self-aware the hard way, to go from wanting to be silent and invisible to earning a living defending the silenced in all caps.\n\nLindy West is a Seattle-based writer, editor, and performer whose work focuses on pop culture, social justice, humor, and body image. She's currently a culture writer for GQ magazine and GQ.com and a weekly columnist at The Guardian, as well as the founder and editor of I Believe You | It's Not Your Fault, an advice blog for teens. In 2015 she wrote and recorded a story for This American Life about confronting an Internet troll who impersonated her dead father. She also was listed as \"Internet's Most Fascinating of 2015\" by Cosmopolitan.com, and helped launch the viral #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag in defense of women's reproductive rights.\n \n\nEvent date: \nThursday, March 23, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.

The woman\u2019s husband, Herbert Weinstein, soon confessed to having hit and strangled his wife after an argument, then dropping her body out of their apartment window to make it look like a suicide. The 65-year-old Weinstein, a quiet, unassuming retired advertising executive, had no criminal record, no history of violent behavior\u2014not even a short temper. How, then, to explain this horrific act?\n \nJournalist Kevin Davis uses the perplexing story of the Weinstein murder to present a riveting, deeply researched exploration of the intersection of neuroscience and criminal justice. Shortly after Weinstein was arrested, an MRI revealed a cyst the size of an orange on his brain\u2019s frontal lobe, the part of the brain that governs judgment and impulse control. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer seized on that discovery, arguing that the cyst had impaired Weinstein\u2019s judgment and that he should not be held criminally responsible for the murder. It was the first case in the United States in which a judge allowed a scan showing a defendant\u2019s brain activity to be admitted as evidence to support a claim of innocence.\n \nThe Weinstein case marked the dawn of a new era in America\u2019s courtrooms, raising complex and often troubling questions about how we define responsibility and free will, how we view the purpose of punishment, and how strongly we are willing to bring scientific evidence to bear on moral questions. Davis brings to light not only the intricacies of the Weinstein case but also the broader history linking brain injuries and aberrant behavior, from the bizarre stories of Phineas Gage and Charles Whitman, perpetrator of the 1966 Texas Tower massacre, to the role that brain damage may play in violence carried out by football players and troubled veterans of America\u2019s twenty-first century wars. The Weinstein case opened the door for a novel defense that continues to transform the legal system: Criminal lawyers are increasingly turning to neuroscience and introducing the effects of brain injuries\u2014whether caused by trauma or by tumors, cancer, or drug or alcohol abuse\u2014and arguing that such damage should be considered in determining guilt or innocence, the death penalty or years behind bars. As he takes stock of the past, present and future of neuroscience in the courts, Davis offers a powerful account of its potential and its hazards.\n \nThought-provoking and brilliantly crafted, The Brain Defense marries a murder mystery complete with colorful characters and courtroom drama with a sophisticated discussion of how our legal system has changed\u2014and must continue to change\u2014as we broaden our understanding of the human mind.\n\nKevin Davis is a Chicago-based journalist and author of Defending the Damned and The Wrong Man. His award-winning writing has appeared in USA Today, The Chicago Tribune, The Utne Reader, Chicago Magazine, The Rumpus, Writer\u2019s Digest, and other publications; he is a former staff reporter for the Sun-Sentinel in South Florida and is an editor at the American Bar Association Journal.\n\nEvent date: \nFriday, March 24, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.
