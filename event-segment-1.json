The Wolverine State has been the birthplace, home, and inspiration to a tremendous number of men and women of letters, both the well-known and the obscure. Ink Trails II tells the stories of these fascinating and diverse writers whose talent is inextricably linked to Michigan.Exploring the hidden treasures of otherwise forgotten authors while also acknowledging the Michigan-set stories of giants like Hemingway, Dave and Jack Dempsey delve into the state\u2019s literary heritage, as robust, diverse, and inexhaustible as the natural beauty of the place that nurtured it. This second volume of \u201cink trails\u201d continues to tell the story of the remarkable writers, powerful words, and sublime nature of Michigan in the same well-researched and entertaining prose as the first.\n\nAbout Yamasaki in Detroit: Although his best-known project was the World Trade Center in New York City, Japanese American architect Minoru Yamasaki (1912\u20131986) worked to create moments of surprise, serenity, and delight in distinctive buildings around the world. In his adopted home of Detroit, where he lived and worked for the last half of his life, Yamasaki produced many important designs that range from public buildings to offices and private residences. In Yamasaki in Detroit: A Search for Serenity, author John Gallagher presents both a biography of Yamasaki\u2014or Yama as he was known\u2014and an examination of his working practices, with an emphasis on the architect\u2019s search for a style that would express his artistic goals. Both knowledgeable fans of modernist architecture and general readers will enjoy Yamasaki in Detroit.\n\nAbout The Orbit Magazine Anthology: With a mischievous globe-headed mascot that appeared in every issue and even on Quentin Tarantino\u2019s T-shirt in Pulp Fiction, Orbit was an instantly recognizable arbiter of 1990s Detroit culture. But its irreverent tone and unique editorial features could be traced to two earlier local publications from creator Jerry Peterson, a.k.a. Jerry Vile\u2014White Noise (1978\u20131980) and Fun: The Magazine for Swinging Intelectuals [sic] (1986\u20131990). In The Orbit Magazine Anthology: Re-Entry, author Rob St. Mary details the full run of White Noise, Fun, and Orbit, collecting two decades\u2019 worth of Detroit\u2019s alternative publishing history into an oversized, heavily illustrated volume that situates the publications in the city\u2019s pop culture and media history. Anyone interested in Detroit arts and culture or the history of alternative publishing will be grateful for The Orbit Magazine Anthology.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, May 2, 2016 - 7:00pm", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-02T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Michigan Notable Books: Dave & Jack Dempsey, John Gallagher, & Rob St. Mary"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1713725442238131/", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\n-       May 3 - Isaac Berkowitz and Chris Bota\nIsaac Berkowitz and Chris Bota are guitarists in the Michigan rock band, Desmond Jones.

Her days are spent designing cool new car parts, but her evenings are filled with writing and cats. She has traveled solo to seventeen countries on five continents. Her other hobbies include hunting for the perfect cup of coffee, exploring used book stores, and accidentally climbing mountains. \n\nElena Bozzi's love of stories began, she imagines, before she was born. From an early age, she learned that stories were beautiful ways to connect with others. Eventually, after consuming copious amounts of written words, she decided it would be proper to give back to the book world. She hopes you will enjoy, are enjoying, or have enjoyed Puddle, her first novel. To write it, she listened deeply to many forests, and knows much of this story came directly from them.\n\n'27 Days to Midnight'\n\nEveryone in Dahlia\u2019s world knows when they\u2019re going to die. Except her.\n\nHer father has never shown her the pocket watch counting down the days she has left to live. When he sacrifices himself to save her from her scheduled death, Dahlia abandons her comfortable home and sets off after his murderer to uncover the secrets her father died to protect\u2026and the time research that could bring him back to life.\n\nThen she meets Farren Reed. She should hate him. He\u2019s an enemy soldier, a cowardly deserter, and the most insufferable man Dahlia\u2019s ever met. Still, she needs all the help she can get, and Farren is the only chance she has to find the man who murdered her father. But Farren has only twenty-seven days left on his watch.\n\n'Puddle: A Tale for the Curious'\n\nBirch loves her garden. Her sanctuary is the nearby forest. She understands that adventures can happen at any moment, especially when there are cats involved. When she witnesses a boy crawl from a puddle that wouldn't cover a toad, she suspends her disbelief in order to see his side of the tale.\n\nGet your feet wet with Birch and Puddle as they travel to worlds by way of the reflections upon puddles. Prowl with Caht, the cat who spells its name with an h, and arrange necessary... encounters.. with Nimupara, the Watcher of Worlds.

Chris will be joined in conversation by Brit Bennett, author of The Mothers (coming from Riverhead in October).\n\nA vivid and assured work of fiction from a major new voice, following the life of a young man growing up, leaving home, and coming back again, marked by the stark beauty of California's Mojave Desert and the various fates of those who leave and those who stay behind. This series of powerful, intertwining stories illuminates Daley Kushner's world--the family, friends and community that have both formed and constrained him, and his new lief in San Francisco. Back home, the desert preys on those who cannot conform: an alfalfa farmer on the outskirts of town; two young girls whose curiosity leads to danger; a black politician who once served as his school's confederate mascot; Daley's mother, an immigrant from Armenia; and Daley himself, introspective and queer. Meanwhile, in another desert on the other side of the world, war threatens to fracture Daley's most meaningful--and most fraught--connection to home, his friendship with Robert Karinger. A luminous debut, Desert Boys traces the development of towns into cities, of boys into men, and the haunting effects produced when the two transformations overlap. Both a bildungsroman and a portrait of a changing place, the book mines the terrain between the desire to escape and the hunger to belong.\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is hilarious, devious, original, and unforgettable; Chris McCormick writes with a joyful swerve and swagger that is all his own.\u201d\u2015Karen Russell, New York Times bestselling author of Vampires in the Lemon Grove\n\n\u201cDesert Boys is a show off's debut, the work of an unabashed polyglot. There seems to be nothing Chris McCormick can't do: smartypants metafictional experiment, heart-pounding thriller, eulogy for boyhood bonds, meditation on sexuality and post-9/11 intolerance. These linked stories assemble into a kind of compound eye through which we glimpse an oft-forgotten corner of California and, most superbly, a fresh take on masculine Americana. McCormick is the artsy outsider, the affectionate anthropologist, the near-feral boy with a wide-angle lens of history.\u201d\u2015Claire Vaye Watkins, author of Battleborn and Gold Fame Citrus\n\n\"In the hands of this young master of purified prose, ambition, love, and the restlessness of boyhood are trapped as if in a crystal vial. No reader will be able to turn away.\"\u2015Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen\n\n\u201cChris McCormick\u2019s book is a gift from the new West. In the dry, highland exurbs of Los Angeles and other exotic places, McCormick crafts lustrous tales of brotherhood, immigrants, love, and paintball. Filled with unforgettable characters, Desert Boys is a deeply moving journey through the natural and emotional landscapes of the American present.\u201d\u2015H\u00e9ctor Tobar, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Down Dark and The Barbarian Nurseries\n\n\u201cThis is a book about place, or really like so many books about place (Dubliners, Winesburg, Ohio) two places, in this case two Californias\u2015San Francisco on the one hand; the less familiar but finely evoked small desert community from which the narrator originates on the other. But it's also a book about shame, two shames, the shame of where we come from, and the shame of leaving it. Through a series of quietly intimate confessions we learn how torn the teller is between past and present, small town and big city, and McCormick captures this tension beautifully in the contrast between his laconic, but frankly feeling prose and his restless formal innovation. Wise and vulnerable by turns, this is a quietly stunning debut.\u201d\u2015Peter Ho Davies, author of The Welsh Girl\n\nChris McCormick was raised in the Antelope Valley. He earned his B.A. at the University of California, Berkeley, and his M.F.A. at the University of Michigan, where he was the recipient of two Hopwood Awards. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, May 4, 2016 - 7:00pm", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-05-04T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Fiction at Literati: Chris McCormick"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1016761265082388/", "description": "Join us to celebrate Ann Arbor's young talent as students from Community High's poetry class share their original work at Bookbound.
