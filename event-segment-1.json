Kinney & Stephen M. Ward", "description": "Literati is pleased to welcome Rebecca J. Kinney and Stephen M. Ward for a discussion of their recent books about Detroit and the people who form its heart.\n\nWhat is the \u201cnew Detroit\u201d that everyone keeps talking about? In Beautiful Wasteland: The Rise of Detroit as America's Postindustrial Frontier, Rebecca J. Kinney reveals that the contemporary story of Detroit\u2019s rebirth is an upcycled version of the American Dream, which has long imagined access to work, home, and upward mobility as race-neutral projects. She tackles key questions about the future of postindustrial America, and shows how the narratives of Detroit\u2019s history are deeply steeped in material and ideological investments in whiteness.\n\nRebecca J. Kinney, who grew up in metropolitan Detroit, is assistant professor in the School of Cultural and Critical Studies at Bowling Green State University.\n\nIn Love and Struggle: The Revolutionary Lives of James and Grace Lee Boggs details both the personal and the political dimensions of the Boggses' lives, highlighting the vital contributions these two figures made to black activist thinking. At once a dual biography of two crucial figures and a vivid portrait of Detroit as a center of activism, Ward's book restores the Boggses, and the intellectual strain of black radicalism they shaped, to their rightful place in postwar American history.\n\nStephen Ward is associate professor in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) and the Residential College at the University of Michigan. He is also a board member of the James and Grace Lee Boggs Center to Nurture Community Leadership in Detroit."}, {"date": "2017-07-26T16:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/715559035303413/", "name": "BYOBG - Bring your own Board Game!", "description": "Bring a game!

Daniel will be joined in conversation by Literati's event manager John Ganiard, a graduate of the Helen Zell Writers' Program.\n\nA \u201cgripping and heartfelt\u201d (The New York Times Book Review) story about two young brothers contending with the love they have for their abusive father, One of the Boys is a stunning, compact debut by a major new talent. The three of them\u2014a twelve-year-old boy, his older brother, their father\u2014have won the war: the father\u2019s term for his bitter divorce and custody battle. They leave their Kansas home and drive through the night to Albuquerque, eager to begin again, united by the thrilling possibility of carving out a new life together. The boys go to school, join basketball teams, make friends. Meanwhile their father works from home, smoking cheap cigars to hide another smell. But soon the little missteps\u2014the dead-eyed absentmindedness, the late night noises, the comings and goings of increasingly odd characters\u2014become worrisome, and the boys find themselves watching their father change, grow erratic, then dangerous.\n\nSet in the sublimely stark landscape of suburban New Mexico and a cramped apartment shut tight to the world, One of the Boys conveys with propulsive prose and extraordinary compassion a young boy\u2019s struggle to hold onto the pieces of his shattered family. Tender, moving and beautiful, Daniel Magariel\u2019s masterful debut is a story of resilience and survival: two foxhole-weary brothers banding together to protect each other from the father they once trusted, but no longer recognize. With the emotional core of A Little Life and the speed of We the Animals, One of the Boys is among the most remarkable debut novels you\u2019ll ever read.\n\nDaniel Magariel is a fiction writer from Kansas City. He has a BA from Columbia University, as well as an MFA from Syracuse University, where he was a Cornelia Carhart Fellow. He has lived in Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, Florida, Colorado, and Hawaii. He currently lives in New York with his wife. One of the Boys is his first novel."}, {"date": "2017-07-26T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/850240101794549/", "name": "Toastmaster's at Sweetwaters", "description": "Sweetwaters and Toastmaster community members are creating a new Toastmasters Club at Sweetwaters!
