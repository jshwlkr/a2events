Albert Kahn: Under Construction focuses on the remarkable archive of photographs from the Highland Park Ford Plant to the Willow Run Bomber Plant. Shot by an array of professional photographers, these often striking documentary images were a novel strategy for conveying information\u2014showing buildings as they grew on site\u2014to busy managers at the main office. UMMA docents will explore these artifacts as photographs\nand evidence of Kahn\u2019s innovative solutions to the architectural challenges of his day.\n\nPublic exhibition tours are generously supported by the Richard and Rosann Noel Fund for Museum Education.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1700743653510313/"}]
