So we know that you are the real deal (and not a member of Team Rocket) please wear a shirt that corresponds with your Pok\u00e9 team. Represent Team Instinct (yellow), Mystic (blue), or Valor (red) and come mingle with your fellow trainers. See that picture above?

His style drew upon numerous international influences including, among others, Modernism and Surrealism. Although not strictly Surrealist, many of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s works manifest a similarly fantastical mood. One of the artist\u2019s most arresting qualities is his ability to imbue scenes of everyday life with an otherworldly, metaphysical power. The photographs in the exhibition, from UMMA\u2019s collections, show the artist using motifs drawn from Mexican religious and indigenous works as well as plant forms, in a Modernist approach to image making. UMMA docents will discuss these motifs and the artist\u2019s use of light as a metaphor and revealer of life, animating even the emptiest and most silent of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s scenes."}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/552831098257555/", "name": "Meet Me at UMMA: Museum Arts Experience for Persons with Mild Memory Loss", "date": "2016-07-17T15:00:00-04:00", "description": "To register for this program, email mdeland@alz.org or call the local Alzheimer\u2019s Association at 800.272.3900 at any time.
