His style drew upon numerous international influences including, among others, Modernism andSurrealism. Although not strictly Surrealist, many of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s works manifest a similarly fantastical mood. One of the artist\u2019s most arresting qualities is his ability to imbue scenes of everyday life with an otherworldly, metaphysical power. The photographs in the exhibition, from UMMA\u2019s collections, show the artist using motifs drawn from Mexican\nreligious and indigenous works as well as plant forms, in a Modernist approach to image making. UMMA docents will discuss these motifs and the artist\u2019s use of light as a metaphor and revealer of life, animating even the emptiest and most silent of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s scenes.\n\nPublic exhibition tours are generously supported by the Richard and Rosann Noel Fund for Museum Education.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-26T14:00:00-04:00", "name": "Guided Tour - Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo: Mexico's Poet of Light"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/126949477712284/", "description": "HELLAWELL...Driftwood on Sand\nFriction Quartet\n\nSHOSTAKOVICH...Sonata for Cello and Piano in D minor, Op. 40\nPaul Watkins, cello; Alessio Bax, piano\n\nBOLCOM...Three Rags for String Quartet\nAltius Quartet\n\nArensky | Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor, Op. 32\nTrio Honor\u00e9\n\nTickets: Please contact Kerrytown Concert House at 734-769-2999 or visit their website for more information.", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-06-26T14:00:00-04:00", "name": "GLCMF at Kerrytown Concert House"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/452279421633430/", "description": "Photographed in nearby Detroit, Catie Newell\u2019s new images from her series Nightly frame scenes of the urban landscape illuminated at night.
