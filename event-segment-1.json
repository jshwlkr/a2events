It represented the chaos of warfare, the automation of war technologies, and the devastation wrought upon soldiers bodies and psyches. Golem: Modern Wars and Their Monstersdraws on some of the most popular and significant renditions of this story in order to unravel the paradoxical coincidence of wartime destruction and the fantasy of artificial creation. Due to its aggressive and rebellious sides, the golem became a means for reflection about how technological progress has altered human lives, as well as an avenue for experimentation with the media and art forms capable of expressing the monstrosity of war.\n\nMaya Barzilai is assistant professor of Hebrew literature and Jewish culture at the University of Michigan. She received her PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2009. Her new book, Golem: Modern Wars and Their Monsters (NYU Press), explores how the infamous monster of clay became a metaphor of war and its destructive technologies across German, Israeli, and American cultures. Barzilai also researches Hebrew-German translation, Hebrew writing on World War I, and Jewish comics. \n\n*\n\nBerlin in the 1920s was a cosmopolitan hub where for a brief, vibrant moment German-Jewish writers crossed paths with Hebrew and Yiddish migrant writers. Working against the prevailing tendency to view German and East European Jewish cultures as separate fields of study, Strangers in Berlin is the first book to present Jewish literature in the Weimar Republic as the product of the dynamic encounter between East and West. Whether they were native to Germany or sojourners from abroad, Jewish writers responded to their exclusion from rising nationalist movements by cultivating their own images of homeland in verse, and they did so in three languages: German, Hebrew, and Yiddish. Author Rachel Seelig portrays Berlin during the Weimar Republic as a threshold between exile and homeland in which national and artistic commitments were reexamined, reclaimed, and rebuilt. In the pulsating yet precarious capital of Germany s first fledgling democracy, the collision of East and West engendered a broad spectrum of poetic styles and Jewish national identities. \n\nRachel Seelig is a fellow at the Frankel Institute for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Michigan. A native of Vancouver, Canada, she received her PhD from the University of Chicago in 2011 and has taught German Studies and Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her articles have appeared in various journals, including Prooftexts, Modern Language Notes, and The Jewish Quarterly Review. Rachel is currently co-editing a volume with Amir Eshel entitled The German-Hebrew Dialogue: Studies of Encounter and Exchange, which will be published by De Gruyter in 2017. Strangers in Berlin is her first book. \n\nEvent date: \nWednesday, November 9, 2016 - 7:00pm", "name": "Maya Barzilai & Rachel Seelig"}, {"date": "2016-11-09T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1254743334545390/", "description": "TICKETS ON SALE NOW: http://bit.ly/1XZq5zj\n\nNecto & React Detroit presents...\n\nLemaitre\nwww.lemaitremusic.com\n\nsupport from\nChet Porter & Coucheron\n\nwww.necto.com\nwww.reactpresents.com\n\nDoors at 9pm | 18 & over welcome with proper ID \n\nNecto located at 516 E Liberty Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104\nFor VIP services contact info@necto.com", "name": "Lemaitre at Necto"}, {"date": "2016-11-10T08:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/324709987912141/", "description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.
