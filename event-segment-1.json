In these true stories, writers and their loved ones struggle as their worlds are upended. What do you do when your father kills himself, or your mother is committed to a psych ward, or your daughter starts hearing voices telling her to harm herselfor when you yourself hear such voices? Addressing bipolar disorder, OCD, trichillomania, self-harm, PTSD, and other diagnoses, these stories depict the difficulties and sorrows--and sometimes, too, the unexpected and surprising rewards--of living with mental illness.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nJennifer Metsker lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan where she is the Writing Coordinator at the Stamps School of Art and Design. Her poetry, which often addresses issues related to mental illness, has appeared or is forthcoming in many journals including The Cincinnati Review, Cimarron Review, Gulf Coast, The Seattle Review, Whiskey Island, Rhino, Cream City Review, and Birdfeast. She has written art reviews for Arthopper and Carbon Culture and recently was awarded the Third Coast Audio Shortdoc Prize for an audio piece that she created with artist Stephanie Rowden. \n\nMadeline Strong Diehl has worked as a magazine journalist, editor, and grant writer for almost 30 years. She has won the T.S. Eliot poetry prize from the University of Kent at Canterbury and published a book of poetry, Wrestling with Angels (2013). Her comedies have been produced Off-Broadway and around the Midwest, and she has published dozens of humorous essays, believe it or not.", "name": "Madeline Diehl & Jennifer Metsker", "date": "2016-08-04T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/212274295832362/", "description": "Kuebler Langford Nature Area is a 31-acre park tucked into a sharp curve of Huron River Drive. Part of the park is old field, and contains native dry prairie species. A deep ravine bisects the park, and moist woods cover its slopes.

For this one, we will meet in the parking lot on the western shoulder of Huron River Drive. Wear comfortable clothes and bring water and bug spray if desired.
