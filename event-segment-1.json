Showcased are some important twentieth-century Austrian and German expressionist artists, including Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Ernst Kirchner, and Oskar Kokoschka, who paved the way for future generations of the avant-garde, and the Italian Giovanni Battista Piranesi, one of the most inventive draftsmen and printmakers of the eighteenth century. The works in this multi- faceted collection capture artistic compulsions and creative responses to the physical and spiritual world, from tangled, emotionally embroiled nudes to meticulous landscapes and architectural vistas. This exemplary gift from late U-M professor emeritus Ernst Pulgram and his wife, associate professor emerita and chief editor of the Middle English Compendium, Frances McSparran, offers a glimpse into the rich history of European graphic art.\n\n\rLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Richard and Rosann Noel Endowment Fund.
