Nenadic & M. Joanne Nesbit for an evening of discussion about Ann Arbor Icons and Legends.\n\nWhat is an iconic Ann Arbor restaurant? Ask anyone who has ever spent time there as a student, traveler, or townie, and they are likely to name several favorites in an instant. From debating the best place to celebrate or console on football Saturdays to deciding where to eat after the bars close, the choices have always sparked passionate conversation. In Ann Arbor, people are known to have strong feelings about the best places for pizza, coffee, beer, burgers, noodles, and burritos. Although many of the go-to hangouts are long gone, a surprising number still thrive. And there are always a few newcomers coming along to win the hearts of the next generation of diners, nibblers, and noshers. Some are fine restaurants and taverns, and others are lunch counters, diners, carry-outs, and drive-ins but in each and every case, they are unique and together make up a collection of iconic local eateries.\n\nGraced by the Huron River with an abundance of parks, Ann Arbor offers residents and visitors entertainment, sports, shopping, dining, and of course, the University of Michigan. Legendary Locals of Ann Arbor celebrates its citizens. Some of those who make up Ann Arbor are creative artists, inspiring educators, dedicated public servants, and determined business owners. With the exception of Lewis the cat, who reigned at Downtown Home and Garden, this book is filled with stories about people who have made and are making Ann Arbor one of the best places to live in the United States. Within its pages lie the stories of who chose maize and blue as the University of Michigan s colors; who was the first Ann Arborite to race in the Indy 500; and who sold Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino s, his first pizzeria. Inside are photographs and descriptions of the legendary people of the past and the present, as well as those who are on their way to becoming the legends of the future.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/660281374136185/", "date": "2016-11-28T19:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Ann Arbor Icons & Legends"}, {"description": "This holiday season, every time you buy one of our Lucky's Market products, 10% of the profits go to Community Action Network (CAN) of Ann Arbor to provide food for families who need some extra help.
