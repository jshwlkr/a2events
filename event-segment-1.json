Alexander will be joined in conversation by Natalie Bakopoulos, author of The Green Shore.\n\nSet in the Pacific Northwest in the jittery, jacked-up early 1990s, Shelter in Place, by one of America\u2019s most thrillingly defiant contemporary authors, is a stylish literary novel about the hereditary nature of mental illness, the fleeting intensity of youth, the obligations of family, and the dramatic consequences of love.\n\nJoseph March, a twenty-one-year-old working class kid from Seattle, has just graduated from college and his future beckons, unencumbered, limitless, magnificent. Joe\u2019s life implodes when he starts to suffer the symptoms of bipolar disorder, and, not long after, his mother, Anne-Marie March, beats a stranger to death with a hammer.\n\nJoe moves to White Pine, Washington, where Anne-Marie is serving time and his father has set up house. He is followed by Tess Wolff, a fiercely independent woman with whom he is in love. Meanwhile, Joe\u2019s mother is gradually being transformed into a national heroine. Many see her crime as a furious, exasperated act of righteous rebellion. Tess, too, is under her spell. Spurred on by Anne-Marie\u2019s example, she enlists Joe in a secret, violent plan that will forever change their lives.\n\nMaksik sings of modern America\u2019s battered soul and of the lacerating emotions that make us human. Magnetic and masterfully told, Shelter in Place is about the things we are willing to die for, and those we\u2019re willing to kill for.\n\n\"Alexander Maksik\u2019s riveting and disturbing novel Shelter in Place is a totally original exploration of mental illness, sexual politics, family and violence.\" --The Guardian. \n\n\"Alexander Maksik covers fresh ground with each new work. In poetic bursts\u2026he captures [his characters\u2019] inner convulsions while exploring the passions that can drive, and destroy, us.\"--Vanity Fair\n\nAlexander Maksik is the author of three novels: You Deserve Nothing; A Marker to Measure Drift, which was named a New York Times Notable Book and a finalist for both the William Saroyan Prize and Le Prix du Meilleur Livre \u00c9tranger; and the forthcoming Shelter in Place, due out in September. A contributing editor at Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, his writing has appeared, or is forthcoming, in Best American Nonrequired Reading, Harper\u2019s, Tin House, Harvard Review, The New York Times Book Review, The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic, Salon and Narrative Magazine, among other publications. Maksik is the recipient of a 2015 Pushcart Prize, as well as fellowships from the Truman Capote Literary Trust and The Corporation of Yaddo. He is the co-artistic director of the Can Cab Literary Residence in Catalonia, Spain and his work has been translated into more than a dozen languages. \n\n \n\nEvent date: \nTuesday, October 11, 2016 - 7:00pm", "name": "Alexander Maksik, with Natalie Bakopoulos", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1796364493915407/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-11T20:00:00-04:00", "description": "Tue.
