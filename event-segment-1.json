In this class we\u2019ll cover the basics of programming the Raspberry Pi in Python, connecting simple switches, LEDs, and sensors, and creating web pages that provide remote sensing and control. We\u2019ll even do our programming right on the Raspberry Pi itself with a full-featured Linux operating system, graphical user interface, editors, and web browsers.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with the Arduino, the Raspberry Pi is a great platform for those projects that need lots more memory, more speed, video output, internet, USB, or other features. Unlike the Arduino, there is no low-cost or reduced size or power option. You may also enjoy the ease and power that Python offers as a programming language, and the many possibilities of the underlying Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nThis is a beginner course, so no electronics or programming experience is necessary. (It may move slow for experienced programmers!)\r\n\r\nWe suggest ages 12 and up, but advanced younger people will probably do fine.\r\n\r\nWe supply a model 2 Raspberry Pi and all parts for use in the class. You\u2019ll take home a comprehensive set of class notes.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the Raspberry Pi at www.raspberrypi.org/\r\nPlease arrive 10 minutes early if visiting Maker Works for the first time. $90\r\nCall Maker Works at 734-222-4911 or visit http://www.supersaas.com/schedule/makerworks/CheckOut?day=14&month=11&year=2016&view=day to sign up.", "date": "2016-11-21T18:00:00-05:00", "name": "Intro to Raspberry Pi", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1669121740084145/"}, {"description": "Art Off The Wall 2016 is the Ann Arbor Art Center's BIGGEST Holiday Exhibition and Shopping Event ever!

Recording for the first time as a solo artist and writing without what he refers to as \"the shackles of genre\", the direction is really a culmination of the variety in his past projects. The sound is still very much grounded in American Roots music but is unbound by the narrow concepts he has applied to previous outings. www.ryanracine.com\n\nThis event is open to the public and donations are encouraged.", "date": "2016-11-23T17:00:00-05:00", "name": "Terminate Hunger Release Fundraiser", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/277779062623282/"}, {"description": "Join us Wednesday, November 23rd from 5pm\u201312am, to celebrate our 3 year anniversary!
