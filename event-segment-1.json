The book is wildly ambitious--spanning more than thirty years, its many events seen through the eyes of a dozen different characters--and just as wildly successful. In prose that zips and smarts, taut and electric, Haigh renders every one of her many characters in all their moving and human complexity. The result is a fully realized world, and an unforgettable novel.\u201d\n\nJennifer Haigh returns to the Pennsylvania town at the center of her iconic novel Baker Towers, in this ambitious, achingly human story of modern America and the conflicting forces at its heart.\n\nForty years ago, Bakerton coal fueled the country. Then the mines closed, and the town wore away like a bar of soap. Now Bakerton has been granted a surprise third act: it sits squarely atop the Marcellus Shale, a massive deposit of natural gas. To drill or not to drill?  Prison guard Rich Devlin leases his mineral rights to finance his dream of farming. He doesn\u2019t count on the truck traffic and nonstop noise, his brother\u2019s skepticism or the paranoia of his wife, Shelby, who insists the water smells strange and is poisoning their frail daughter.  Meanwhile his neighbors, organic dairy farmers Mack and Rena, hold out against the drilling\u2014until a passionate environmental activist disrupts their lives.\n\nHeat and Light depicts a community blessed and cursed by its natural resources. Soaring, ambitious, it zooms from drill rig to shareholders\u2019 meeting to the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor to the ruined landscape of the \u201cstrippins,\u201d haunting reminders of Pennsylvania\u2019s past energy booms.  This is a dispatch from a forgotten America\u2014a work of searing moral clarity from one of the finest writers of her generation, a courageous and necessary book.\n\n\u201cHeat and Light achieves pure novelistic virtuosity. It\u2019s brilliant beginning to end.\u201d \u2014 Richard Ford\n\n\u201cHeat and Light is a work of tremendous sweep and ambition, a timely, inventive novel powered by Jennifer Haigh\u2019s remarkable compassion for her characters.\u201d \u2014 Jess Walter, author of Beautiful Ruins\n\n\u201cParagraph by paragraph, the prose is full of marvelous texture and material sensation. Heat and Light is an intricate and ambitious novel, firmly grounded in history and our time. The narrator\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge and keen insights about the physical world and social life make the novel a thrilling page turner.\u201d \u2014Ha Jin, National Book Award-winning author of Waiting\n\nJennifer Haigh is the author of four previous novels: Faith, The Condition, Baker Towers, and Mrs. Kimble, winner of the PEN/Hemingway Award for debut fiction. Her short story collection News from Heaven won the Massachusetts Book Award and the PEN New England Award in Fiction. Haigh's short stories have appeared in The Atlantic, Granta, The Best American Short Stories and many other places.

Even as her compressed stories are unfolding on a suburban cul de sac, they are deep in the mythical woods, \u201cwhere children, despite their commonness, / are a delicacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaggie Smith\u2019s collection is magical and troubling.\u2026 Time alternates between the forest where there are refrigerator magnets and safety belts, and The Forest where you, a now-human you, once preened \u2018your blue-black wings.\u2019\u2026 Time stops for violence and passion. Be intrigued. Find yourself welcome.\u201d \u2014 Kimiko Hahn\n\n\u201cSome kind of primary mythic world lies behind and throughout these adult tales of ultimate matters.\u2026 as much about the terrible and beautiful dreams of children as it is about waking up as a parent. This is a rare book of poems.\u201d \u2014 Stanley Plumly\n\n\u201cEnchantment: that rarest of all poetic gifts. As when the neurons, in the kaleidoscopic movie they call a \u201cfunctional MRI,\u201d speak to us in colors on a screen from the deepest recesses of what we already know. Maggie Smith\u2019s are poems of transformation: haunting, gorgeous, intimately unsettling. I cannot remember when I last read a book to match her powers of delight.\u201d \u2014 Linda Gregerson\n\n\u201cFolk tales and their eerie, animistic wisdom are a wellspring for these powerful lyrics. The poems are ethereal and dark, brimming with dread, beauty, and rapture. The Bloody Chamber, Angela Carter\u2019s arresting prose engagement with fairy tales, comes to mind. Smith updates motifs of the pacts children make with nature, the power of luck and curses, loss of innocence, the vulnerable and the sinister, primal fears of being eaten, and much more. The images are so fresh and inventive they shimmer. Original, cautionary, rich, delicious, The Well Speaks\u2026is a spellbinding collection.\u201d \u2014 Amy Gerstler\n\nMaggie Smith holds a BA from Ohio Wesleyan University and an MFA from The Ohio State University. Her previous books are Lamp of the Body (Red Hen Press, 2005) and three prizewinning chapbooks, Disasterology (Dream Horse Press, forthcoming), The List of Dangers (Kent State/Wick Poetry Series, 2010), and Nesting Dolls (Pudding House, 2005).
