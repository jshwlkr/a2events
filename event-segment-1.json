Within a six-month span, the Tigers, Lions, and Red Wings won a World Series, NFL title, and Stanley Cup -- a major-sports trifecta achieved by no other American city before or since -- and it happened as undefeated local boxer Joe Louis was becoming a national sensation. As the successes mounted, the national media made heroes of the city's sports stars, and Detroit grew almost delirious, the string of victories providing a sweet diversion from the Great Depression. \n \nBut beneath the jubilance, a nefarious plague was spreading unchecked. A wave of mysterious crimes had police baffled: bodies dumped along roadsides, suspicious suicides, bombings of homes and halls, flogging victims who refused to speak, assassination plots. All were the work of the Black Legion, a secret terrorist organization that flourished in Detroit until the summer of 1936, when one murder (and the loose lips of a gunman) led to its unraveling.", "name": "Meet Michigan Author & Award Winning Journalist Tom Stanton for a Discussion of 'Terror in the City of Champions'", "date": "2016-06-06T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/254551728239861/", "description": "amateureyes.bandcamp.com\ngr8xpect8ns.bandcamp.com\ncomplainer.bandcamp.com\nhttps://m.facebook.com/naturesgarbage/\n\n$5 cover", "name": "amateur eyes, Complainer, Natures Garbage, and Great Expectations at the Cl", "date": "2016-06-06T23:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/831264297006986/", "description": "Join us for a brew and a book signing with local author, Stephen Johnson, and his new title from Arcadia Publishing & The History Press, Detroit Beer!

Untethered explores what bonds truly form a family and how, sometimes, love knows no bounds.\n\nChar Hawthorn, college professor, wife and stepmother to a spirited fifteen-year-old daughter, loves her family and the joyful rhythms of work and parenting. But when her husband dies in a car accident, the \u201cstep\u201d in Char\u2019s title suddenly matters a great deal. In the eyes of the law, all rights to daughter Allie belong to Lindy, Allie\u2019s self-absorbed biological mother, who wants to girl to move to her home in California.\n\nWhile Allie begins to struggle in school and tensions mount between her and Char, Allie\u2019s connection to young Morgan, a ten-year-old-girl she tutors, seems to keep her grounded. But then Morgan, who was adopted out of foster care, suddenly disappears, and Char is left to wonder about a possible future without Allie and what to do about Morgan, a child caught up in a terrible crack in the system.\n\nJulie Lawson Timmer grew up in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. She lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan with her husband, their four teenage children and two rescued dogs. By turns, she is a writer, lawyer, mom/stepmom, and dreadful cook. Five Days Left (Putnam 2014) is her first novel. Her second book, Untethered, will be available June 7, 2016.\n\nEvent date: \nTuesday, June 7, 2016 - 7:00pm", "name": "Julie Lawson Timmer", "date": "2016-06-07T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/631220000369326/", "description": "Literati is delighted to welcome Nathan Bomey in support of Detroit Resurrected: To Bankruptcy and Back.\n\nIn Detroit Resurrected, Nathan Bomey delivers the inside story of the fight to save Detroit against impossible odds. Bomey, who covered the bankruptcy for the Detroit Free Press, provides a gripping account of the tremendous clash between lawyers, judges, bankers, union leaders, politicians, philanthropists, and the people of Detroit themselves.\n\nThe battle to rescue this iconic city pulled together those who believed in its future\u2014despite their differences. Help came in the form of Republican governor Rick Snyder, a technocrat who famously called himself \u201cone tough nerd\u201d; emergency manager Kevyn Orr, a sharp-shooting lawyer and \u201cyellow-dog Democrat\u201d; and judges Steven Rhodes and Gerald Rosen, the key architects of the grand bargain that would give the city a second chance at life.\n\nDetroit had a long way to go. Facing a legacy of broken promises, the city had to seek unprecedented sacrifices from retirees and union leaders, who fought for their pensions and benefits. It had to confront the consequences of years of municipal corruption while warding off Wall Street bond insurers who demanded their money back. And it had to consider liquidating the Detroit Institute of Arts, whose world-class collection became an object of desire for the city\u2019s numerous creditors. In a tight, suspenseful narrative, Detroit Resurrected reveals the tricky path to rescuing the city from $18 billion in debt and giving new hope to its citizens.\n\nBased on hundreds of exclusive interviews, insider sources, and thousands of records, Detroit Resurrected gives a sweeping account of financial ruin, backroom intrigue, and political rebirth in the struggle to reinvent one of America\u2019s iconic cities.\n\nNathan Bomey, a journalist at USA Today, was the lead reporter on Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy and General Motors for the Detroit Free Press.
