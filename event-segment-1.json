Beginning in 2010, Opie spent six months taking photographs at the Bel Air, California, residence of Elizabeth Taylor (1932\u20132011). The exhibition includes 50 works drawn from two series, Closets and Jewels and 700 Nimes Road. Opie\u2019s lens captures the essence of the Hollywood legend through her personal objects and mementos, and portrays Taylor\u2019s life experience and eccentricity as an illusory subject, one that cannot be specifically designated or precisely described. In the artist\u2019s words, the project is not about the relationship to celebrity but about \u201cthe relationship to what is human.\u201d\nCatherine Opie: 700 Nimes Road is organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

Her investigations combine architectural research, material studies, and art experiments, a strategy she began as a student that now defines her career.\n\nThe most important element in her formal vocabulary is light, not only as a \u201cmaterial\u201d in its own right, but also as a condition. Varying in strength, form, and duration, light constructs architecture as a situational experience rather than a fixed space. Newell\u2019s fascination with light is a fascination with darkness. Through urban interventions, installations, and photographs, she investigates how darkness creates alternate environments, with unseen geographies, untold histories, and secret identities.\n\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L.

She is a past-president of the Michigan Council of Teachers of English and a former Director of the Oakland Writing Project. \n\nEssence LaFontaine and Grace Woodson don\u2019t know each other, but soon Hurricane Katrina will blow into their lives, forcing them together into a different kind of storm\u2014a storm swirling with the winds of bigotry and prejudice. Can the girls find their way to the light behind the clouds?\n\nNew Orleans: Essence watches her neighbors prepare to evacuate, but her stubborn grandma refuses to budge, jeopardizing the lives of both her granddaughters, Essence and her little sister, Chardonnai, while their mother works as a nurse at a local hospital.\n\nHouston: Grace listens to her iPod and sighs when her mom urges her to finish her summer reading, but Grace can think only of her forbidden MySpace page.\n\nKatrina strikes with a fury and although Essence and Chardonnai are rescued, their grandmother Mimmi stays behind with their skinny poodle, George. After terrifying hours in the Superdome they board a bus for the Houston Astrodome along with other victims of Hurricane Katrina, including a man named Harold, who Essence strongly suspects is her long-lost father.\n\nAfter Grace is suspended from St. Catherine\u2019s for her disobedient behavior, she accompanies her father, a psychologist, to the Astrodome to help with the evacuees.\n\nSo Grace begins her essay for English class, her attempt to describe her day with the pitiful Katrina victims. She sees before her the lessons of her required reading, To Kill a Mockingbird, and at a loss as to what to do, she begins to read the book aloud to a tattered group including Essence and her new family of fellow survivors.\n\nWith the city of New Orleans devastated, the Woodson family allows Essence and Chardonnai to live with them and both girls begin school at St. Catherine\u2019s.
