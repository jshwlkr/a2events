In Proxies an original constraint, a \u201ctotal suppression of recourse to authoritative sources,\u201d engineers Brian Blanchfield\u2019s disarming mode of independent intellection. The \u201crepeatable experiment\u201d to draw only from what he knows, estimates, remembers, and misremembers about the subject at hand often opens onto an unusually candid assessment of self and situation. The project\u2019s driving impulse, courting error, peculiar in an era of crowd-sourced Wiki-knowledge, is at least as old as the one Montaigne had when, putting all the books back on the shelf, he asked, \u201cWhat do I know?\u201d\n\n\"Into what some are calling a new golden age of creative nonfiction lands Brian Blanchfield\u2019s Proxies, which singlehandedly raises the bar for what\u2019s possible in the field. This is a momentous work informed by a lifetime of thinking, reading, loving, and reckoning, utterly matchless in its erudition, its precision, its range, its daring, and its grace. I know of no book like it, nor any recent book as thoroughly good, in art or in heart.\"  \u2014Maggie Nelson\n\n\"Proxies: Essays Near Knowing brings a slowed-to-meaning lens to the remembered moments of a life. Blanchfield\u2019s readers wander into his ordinary-extraordinary quotidian\u2014the vulnerable longing of a singular voice expressing a peopled intelligence. Not since Hilton Als\u2019s White Girls have I read anything as interrogative, unsettling, and brilliant.\"  \u2014Claudia Rankine\n\n\"Brian Blanchfield\u2019s sentences are modern marvels.  They coil, insinuate, embellish\u2014and then land on the tender spot.  If Hart Crane had survived to write a book of autobiographical essays, it would resemble Proxies\u2014but would Hart have given us the low-down on frottage?  Blanchfield is a staggeringly accomplished stylist, whose artful elucidations deserve to be savored, studied, and, yes, worshipped.\"  \u2014Wayne Koestenbaum\n\n\"Early on his humble and stunning Proxies, Brian Blanchfield asks: \u201cIn what kind of place is all the hearing overhearing?\u201d He knows, mostly we eavesdrop on ourselves. We call it thinking. There is no delicacy of mind like that one that moves through the facts of its own errors to arrive at understanding, and here, essay by essay, Blanchfield sifts through the astray archive of his memory to recall what all it is he needs to live. These essays remind us, as they discover inside themselves, the deep virtue of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\"  \u2014Dan Beachy-Quick\n\n\"Maybe short says it best. Sexy book.\"  \u2014Eileen Myles\n\n\"Blanchfield\u2019s best known as a poet, and though poetry shows up here as a subject, this isn\u2019t a poet\u2019s essay collection, meaning that these aren\u2019t hyperlyric half-prose essays shot with the poetry cannon: this is a book of excellent prose written by someone born to write exactly this. These are high-wire acts that are a ton of fun to read\u2026performing close readings of cultural phenomena and tracking\u2014with great, even heroic care\u2014minor and major emotional transactions and tendencies. The result is a book of dynamic, thoughtful, and flat-out moving essays.\"   \u2014Ander Monson\n\nBrian Blanchfield is the author of two books of poetry, Not Even Then and A Several World, which received the 2014 James Laughlin Award and was a longlist finalist for the National Book Award. Recent essays and poems have appeared in Harper\u2019s, BOMB, Brick, Guernica, The Nation, Chicago Review, The Brooklyn Rail, A Public Space, Lana Turner, The Paris Review, and The Awl.
