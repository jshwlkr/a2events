[{"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/171422059934834/", "description": "Literati is pleased to welcome staff-favorite Roy Scranton in support of his novel, War Porn.\n\nAbout the book:\n\n\u201cWar porn,\u201d n. Videos, images, and narratives featuring graphic violence, often brought back from combat zones, viewed voyeuristically or for emotional gratification. Such media are often presented and circulated without context, though they may be used as evidence of war crimes. \n\nWar porn is also, in Roy Scranton\u2019s searing debut novel, a metaphor for the experience of war in the age of the War on Terror, the fracturing and fragmentation of perspective, time, and self that afflicts soldiers and civilians alike, and the global networks and face-to-face moments that suture our fragmented lives together. In War Porn three lives fit inside one another like nesting dolls: a restless young woman at an end-of-summer barbecue in Utah; an American soldier in occupied Baghdad; and Qasim al-Zabadi, an Iraqi math professor, who faces the US invasion of his country with fear, denial, and perseverance. As War Porn cuts from America to Iraq and back again, as home and hell merge, we come to see America through the eyes of the occupied, even as we see Qasim become a prisoner of the occupation. Through the looking glass of War Porn, Scranton reveals the fragile humanity that connects Americans and Iraqis, torturers and the tortured, victors and their victims.\n\n\"What impresses is the brutal immediacy of the writing, its authority. Roy Scranton is a truth telling war writer.\"\u2014E.L. Doctorow, National Book Critics Circle Award-winning author of Ragtime and The March\n\n\"War Porn is dire, savage, and brilliant, a simmering fever-dream of a novel that's as pure and true in its vision of the long war as anything I've read. Roy Scranton is merciless\u2014and why should he be anything but? War's corruption soaks through every layer of life, and War Porn drives home that truth with unflinching, and ultimately harrowing, honesty.\"\u2014Ben Fountain, author of Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk \n\n\u201cRoy Scranton\u2019s searingly honestly first novel is surreal, ultra-real, and like everything he writes from the heart. This examination of the tragedy of what happened in Iraq reaches out to touch of all us. A brilliant literary achievement.\u201d\u2014Jeff VanderMeer, New York Times Best Selling author of Area X: The Southern Reach Trilogy\n\n\"This book is truly unique\u2014true in its fidelity to fact, unique in the depth of its empathy. In prose that rises to aphoristic, coruscating brilliance, Iraq vet Roy Scranton has painted, in words, the equivalent of Goya's war etchings. A rare and genuine masterpiece.\"\u2014Joydeep Roy-Bhattacharya, author of The Watch and The Storyteller of Marrakesh\n\n\u201cRoy Scranton makes us feel the brutalizing affects of war on both Iraqi civilians and American soldiers from the inside out. War Porn seduces, then delivers a sucker-punch no one will forget. This is one of the most honest and propaganda-free novels about the Iraq War yet written.\u201d\u2014Helen Benedict, author of Sand Queen and The Lonely Soldier\n\n\"Roy Scranton has created a singular structure to house public and private memory of the long Iraq War. His war stories illuminate, horrify, and seduce. This is a novel of rare ambition\u2014War Porn gripped me as I read it and haunts me still.\"\u2014Hilary Plum, author of They Dragged Them through the Streets\n\n\"I have never read a book like War Porn. Roy Scranton writes with unnerving power. There is much to admire here\u2014the meticulous craftsmanship, the hysterical comic passages, the way the sheer audacity of vision is matched at every turn by the innovative skill to carry it out\u2014but what I'm left with at the end is difficult to put into words. It's intense and troubling. It's what all truly excellent literature leaves you with. A sense of something shattering.\"\u2014Phil Klay, National Book Award-winning author of Redeployment\n\n\"A harrowing novel of the Iraq invasion and occupation, WAR PORN exposes the dark heart of that war for all to see. Brilliant and stark, WAR PORN is that rare book that demands to be read out of sheer significance\u2014a stunning accomplishment.\"\u2014Matt Gallagher, author of Youngblood\n\nRoy Scranton is the author of the novel War Porn (Soho Press, 2016) and the philosophical essay Learning to Die in the Anthropocene (City Lights, 2015).
