Bomey, who covered the bankruptcy for the Detroit Free Press, provides a gripping account of the tremendous clash between lawyers, judges, bankers, union leaders, politicians, philanthropists, and the people of Detroit themselves.\n\nThe battle to rescue this iconic city pulled together those who believed in its future\u2014despite their differences. Help came in the form of Republican governor Rick Snyder, a technocrat who famously called himself \u201cone tough nerd\u201d; emergency manager Kevyn Orr, a sharp-shooting lawyer and \u201cyellow-dog Democrat\u201d; and judges Steven Rhodes and Gerald Rosen, the key architects of the grand bargain that would give the city a second chance at life.\n\nDetroit had a long way to go. Facing a legacy of broken promises, the city had to seek unprecedented sacrifices from retirees and union leaders, who fought for their pensions and benefits. It had to confront the consequences of years of municipal corruption while warding off Wall Street bond insurers who demanded their money back. And it had to consider liquidating the Detroit Institute of Arts, whose world-class collection became an object of desire for the city\u2019s numerous creditors. In a tight, suspenseful narrative, Detroit Resurrected reveals the tricky path to rescuing the city from $18 billion in debt and giving new hope to its citizens.\n\nBased on hundreds of exclusive interviews, insider sources, and thousands of records, Detroit Resurrected gives a sweeping account of financial ruin, backroom intrigue, and political rebirth in the struggle to reinvent one of America\u2019s iconic cities.\n\nNathan Bomey, a journalist at USA Today, was the lead reporter on Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy and General Motors for the Detroit Free Press. He lives in the Washington, DC, area.", "date": "2016-06-08T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Nathan Bomey: Detroit Resurrected"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/138543229893757/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Your favorite dinner spot just became your favorite lunch spot.\nBringing great food, and quick service to your lunch break.

Laith Al-Saadi was crowned \u201cKing of the Blues\u201d by Guitar Center making him one of the top 4 Blues guitarists in the Country.  Laith has been a staple of the Michigan music scene for most of his adult life.  He has shared the stage with greats like Buddy Guy, BB King, Taj Mahal, Kenny Wayne Shepard, Luther Allison, Son Seals & Johnny Winter.  Laith is one of the best and most polished guitar-driven acts you are likely to find on earth.  In 2013, Al-Saadi teamed up with producer Jeffrey Weber and an all star cast of L.A. session legends to make his third release \"REAL.\". The album was recorded live to 2-track with no edits, overdubs, autotune or compression at the world famous Ocean Way Recording Studios in Hollywood. The album features a dream-band of musicians such as Jim Keltner (Drums), Leland Sklar (Bass), Larry Goldings (Hammond B-3), Jimmy Vivino (Rhythm Gtr/ Backing Vox), Tom Scott (Sax), Lee Thornburg (Tpt), Brandon Fields (Bari Sax), Nick Lane (Trombone / Horn Arranger) and more... \nThe soulful new album harkens back to the great musical traditions of New Orleans and Chicago with a splash of Blues, Country, Gospel, and Roots Rock and is arguably Al-Saadi's best work to date.\nhttp://www.laithmusic.com \n\n2016 Bank of Ann Arbor's Sonic Lunch\n----------------------\n6/02 - Wild Belle\n6/09 - Laith Al-Saadi\n6/14 - frontier ruckus\n6/23 - JR JR w/s/g Joe Hawley of Tally Hall\n6/30 - Ben Daniels Band\n7/07 - The Outer Vibe\n7/14 - The Suffers\n7/28 - Brett Dennen w/s/g The Accidentals\n8/04 - Joshua Davis\n8/11 - The Ragbirds\n8/18 - Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers\n8/25 - Serena Ryder\nall headliners start at 12PM and shows with openers will start at 11:30AM\n\nStarted in 2008, Bank of Ann Arbor\u2019s Sonic Lunch is a free summer outdoor concert series happening at the corner of Liberty and Division in downtown Ann Arbor.

This collection of twenty-two short stories serves as a celebration not only of the tenth anniversary of the Made in Michigan Writers Series in 2016 but also of the rich history of writing and storytelling in the region. As series editors Michael Delp and M. L. Leibler state in their preface, \"The stories contained in this anthology are a way to stay connected to each other. Think of them as messages sent from all over the map, stitching readers and writers together through stories that continue to honor the ancient art of the fire tale, the hunting epic, and all of the ways language feeds the blood of imagination.\"\n\nGloria Whelan is the bestselling author of many novels for young readers, including Homeless Bird, winner of the National Book Award; Fruitlands: Louisa May Alcott Made Perfect; Angel on the Square; Burying the Sun; Once on This Island, winner of the Great Lakes Book Award; and Return to the Island.

Her short stories and essays can be found in Slice, Crack the Spine, Spindrift, Oasis: A Literary Magazine, Willard & Maple, The Homestead Review, Current Magazine, and Porcupine Literary Arts Magazine.\n\nInvincible Summers was a semi-finalist for The Iowa Short Fiction & John Simmons Short Fiction Award for 2014. She received her MA in journalism from Michigan State University and worked as a research intern at Rolling Stone while freelancing for various music publications. Robin\u2019s interviewed or reviewed acts as diverse as Peter, Paul and Mary to Alice in Chains.

How, Claudia wonders, will she fit into this new fatherless world with the old one still going on around her?\n \nInvincible Summers follows Claudia through eleven summers, from the age of six through twenty-three, as she adjusts with varying degrees of success to what it means to be a daughter, a sister, friend, and lover in a world of loss, betrayal and bad judgment.\n \nSet in a middle class suburb outside of Detroit in the 1960s and 1970s, the novel shows Claudia\u2019s pursuit to find a purpose as she struggles with feelings of rootlessness in a world torn apart by assassinations, riots, and the Vietnam War. It is a coming-of-age story of one woman\u2019s journey through the guilt and responsibility she feels for her father\u2019s death, her mother\u2019s career-altering disfiguration, and her brother\u2019s downslide into drugs.\n \nInvincible Summers weaves a tale about grief and forgiveness and the indelible heartbreak of all the things left unsaid.", "date": "2016-06-09T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "EVENT CANCELED TO BE RESCHEDULED LATER -Meet Michigan Author Robin Gaines for a Discussion & Signing of 'Invincible Summers'"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/605818912926151/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Shutta Crum writes picture books for children, novels for teens and poetry for adults.
