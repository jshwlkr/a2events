On one side, the wealthy wield power and advantage, wittingly or not, to keep the system operating in their favor\u2014all while retreating into enclaves that separate them further and further from the poor and working class. On the other side, those who find it increasingly difficult to keep up or get ahead lash out\u2014waging a rhetorical war against the rich and letting anger and resentment, however justifiable, keep us from seeing new potential solutions.\n\nBut can we suspend both class wars long enough to consider a new way forward? Is it really good for anyone that most of society\u2019s wealth is pooling at the very top of the wealth ladder? Does anyone, including the one percent, really want to live in a society plagued by economic apartheid? It is time to think differently, says longtime inequality expert and activist Chuck Collins. Born into the one percent, Collins gave away his inheritance at 26 and spent the next three decades mobilizing against inequality. He uses his perspective from both sides of the divide to deliver a new narrative. Collins calls for a ceasefire and invites the wealthy to come back home, investing themselves and their wealth in struggling communities.  And he asks the non-wealthy to build alliances with the one percent and others at the top of the wealth ladder.\n\nStories told along the way explore the roots of advantage, show how taxpayers subsidize the wealthy, and reveal how charity, used incorrectly, can actually reinforce extreme inequality. Readers meet pioneers who are crossing the divide to work together in new ways, including residents in the author\u2019s own Boston-area neighborhood who have launched some of the most interesting community transition efforts in the nation. In the end, Collins\u2019s national and local solutions not only challenge inequality but also respond to climate change and offer an unexpected, fresh take on one of our most intransigent problems.\n\n\u201cI have never read a story remotely like the one Chuck Collins has to tell. Born to the one percent, in circumstances few of us can imagine, he grew an outsized conscience and gave up his inherited wealth for a life of fighting the vicious inequality that is destroying our country. Somewhere along the way, he came to understand that the rich can be part of the solution instead of the problem and started organizing them to join in the struggle for a fair economy. The result is an electrifying challenge to the affluent as well as the one percent. \u2018Come out of your gated communities and gated hearts,\u2019 he writes, because outside lies the warmth of human solidarity.\u201d--Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed\n\nChuck Collins is a researcher, campaigner, storyteller, and writer based at the Institute for Policy Studies where he co-edits Inequality.org. He has written extensively on wealth inequality in previous books like 99 to 1, Wealth and Our Commonwealth (with Bill Gates Sr.), and Economic Apartheid in America as well as in The Nation, The American Prospect, and numerous other magazines and news outlets. Collins grew up in the 1 percent as the great grandson of meatpacker Oscar Mayer, but at age 26 he gave away his inheritance. He has been working to reduce inequality and strengthen communities since 1982 and in the process has cofounded numerous initiatives, including Wealth for the Common Good (now merged with the Patriotic Millionaires), United for a Fair Economy, and Divest-Invest. He is also a leader in the transition movement, and a co-founder of the Jamaica Plain New Economy Transition and the Jamaica Plain Forum, both in the Boston-area community in which he lives.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/179229159178583/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-28T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Tritonal: Painting With Dreams - Ann Arbor", "description": "We're bringing the Painting With Dreams tour to Necto Nightclub in Ann Arbor!\n\nNew album, a brand new stage production, and most important, all of our Tritonians of Michigan under one roof!!!!\n\nMore info and tickets - http://paintingwithdreams.com/\n\nSee you this fall!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1731098520471774/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-29T08:00:00-04:00", "name": "Impact Day benefiting Girls on the Run", "description": "Girls on the Run of Southeastern Michigan provides a 10 week after-school program for girls in 3rd-5th grade, teaching inspiration through physical, emotional, social and mental development. 10% of our sales on this day will go to support girls in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/671611199664649/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-29T18:00:00-04:00", "name": "Oktoberfest Tap Takeover", "description": "Our taps will be flowing with our new favorite seasonals, we'll have our made in-house sausages, and we heard a rumor Kevin's going to be in lederhosen.

The book and the exhibition contain 50 photographs and are the product of an anarchist\u2019s heart, a historian\u2019s mind and an artist\u2019s eye. Bureaucratics is a comparative photographic study of the culture, rituals and symbols of state civil administrations and its servants in eight countries on five continents, selected on the basis of political, historical and cultural considerations: Bolivia, China, France, India, Liberia, Russia, the United States, and Yemen. In each country, Jan visited up to hundreds of offices of members of the executive in different services and at different levels. The visits were unannounced and the accompanying writer, Will Tinnemans, by interviewing kept the employees from tidying up or clearing the office. That way, the photos show what a local citizen would be confronted with when entering.\n\nThe photography has a conceptual, typological approach reminding of August Sander\u2019s \u2018Menschen des 20 Jahrhunderts\u2019 (\u2018People of the Twentieth Century\u2019). Each subject is posed behind his or her desk. The photos all have a square format (fitting the subject), are shot from the same height (that of the client), with the desk \u2013 its front or side photographed parallel to the horizontal edges of the frame \u2013 serving as a bulwark protecting the representative of rule and regulation against the individual citizen, the warm-blooded exception. They are full of telling details that sometimes reveal the way the state proclaims its power or the bureaucrat\u2019s rank and function, sometimes of a more private character and are accompanied by information such as name, age, function and salary. Though there is a high degree of humour and absurdity in these photos, they also show compassion with the inhabitants of the state\u2019s paper labyrinth.\n\nThe project Bureaucratics has been made possible with financial support from the Foundation for Democracy and Media, Stichting Fonds Anna Cornelis, NCDO and SBKU Utrecht (Committee for the Promotion of Visual Arts).\n\n*\n\nLaw & Order is a photo project that compares the criminal justice system in four different countries on four continents: Colombia (South-America), France (Europe), Uganda (Africa) and the United States (North-America). It combines an artistic view with a documentary approach and sheds light on the key institutions within the criminal justice system: the police, the courts and prisons. Thanks to the avoidance of visual clich\u00e9s \u2013 hands gripping prison bars, humbly bowed, seated prisoners and the like \u2013 that do little other than confirm the existing image, it can contribute to the international debate on criminal law. It raises questions such as: how do we deal with criminals? What is the relationship between punishment and crime? Is confinement, besides being an instrument of punishment, also effective as a means of correction?\n\nThe choice of the four countries was made in consultation with the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law (MPI) in Freiburg, Germany, a scientific institute respected worldwide. Criteria were \u2013 besides being able to gain access \u2013 the diversity of legal systems (civil law and common law), the murder rate and a division between developed and developing countries.\n\nThe police and the judiciary come up frequently in the public debate and are a favorite subject for populist politics. There is rarely sympathy for criminals and politicians\u2019 arguments for harsher penalties \u201cbecause this cannot continue\u201d find a receptive ear with large parts of the population in many countries. However, statistics show that developments in the field of serious crime are not necessarily unfavorable: murder and violent crimes in large parts of Europe are declining steadily over the past decade or two \u2013 and even longer in the US.\n\nLaw & Order is presented in the form of a book and an international traveling exhibition. In addition to the photographs, both contain relevant information and infographics (source: Max Planck Institute); the book also contains an introduction by Dutchman Michiel Scholtes about his experiences as a convict in a French prison.\n\n*\n\nJan Banning is a Dutch autonomous artist/photographer, based in Utrecht, the Netherlands. He was born in Almelo (Netherlands) on May 4, 1954, from Dutch East Indies parents, and he studied social and economic history at the Radbout University of Nijmegen. Banning\u2019s art work has been acquired by museums such as the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; and the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.

Christian followed his love for spleen-rattling bass to San Francisco in 2000, where he met up with the now legendary Dirtybird crew. The dirtybird BBQ was the brainchild of the four original members \u2013 Christian & his brother Justin Martin, and friends Claude VonStroke and Worthy. They had a personal mission to change the landscape of San Francisco house music by throwing an epic free party in the park, based on their new signature sound.\nIn 2003, with nothing to lose and everything to gain, Christian bought a massive yet necessary sound system on his credit card. This set the standard for a new era of die-hard dedicated DIY producers, all with productions based on heavy bass-lines, smiling faces and dance floor delights.\nIn 2006, Christian began releasing a steady stream of tracks, first collaborating with Justin under the \u201cMartin Brothers\u201d alias, as well as Claude VonStroke. The Martin Brothers partnership has produced such hip-hop influenced hits as \u2018Duckface\u2019, \u2018Stoopit\u2019, & \u2018Dum\u2019, as well as remixes for Ed Banger and Fool's Gold. On his own, he's released his own brand of bassy house music on labels such as dirtybird, Trapez, and Anabatic. His low end take on tech house has led to remixes for musical heavyweights such as Chromeo, Underworld, L-Vis 1990, and many more.\nChristian's devotion to large scale bass has allowed him to champion the dirtybird sound out of the park and onto giant soundsystems at clubs and festivals worldwide. From Fusion (Germany) to Shambhala (Canada), to Coachella & Symbiosis (US), there's a constant demand for what he describes as \u201cbass from the ground up.\u201d In San Francisco, Christian is a resident at dirtybird's raucous quarterly party at Mezzanine; and also at Monarch, the newly opened marvel of a club. His new musical alias Leroy Peppers has recently roared to life, offering an even heavier take on hip-hop influenced bass music. Whether it be Leroy or Christian behind the decks, if your hands aren't clapping your ass surely will be. \n\nOpening sets by:\nTwin Cousin\nAdam Westing\n\nAdvance tickets: $10\n4 pack advance tickets: $20\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/christianmartin\nhttp://dirtybird.wikia.com/wiki/Christian_Martin\nhttps://twitter.com/sfdirtybird\nhttps://www.facebook.com/christianmartinmusic/?fref=ts\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/dirtybirdrecords", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/604867786353472/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-30T16:00:00-04:00", "name": "Cucurbita Smiles Pumpkin Pour", "description": "It's happening again!
