Four decades into a stellar career of uncompromising musical integrity, the man simply delivers, night after night \u2013 songs of passion, songs of insight, songs of humor, all rendered in that pure and powerful tenor which, like fine wine, has only grown sweeter with age.\nThis is one veteran performer who is neither grizzled nor nostalgic.  \nJonathan's  highly respected repertoire  includes such classics as, \u201cSometimes,\u201d \u201cOne Day Closer,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Cry Blue,\u201d \u201cEmma,\u201d \u201cEverybody Knows Her,\u201d \u201cAthens County,\u201d and everyone\u2019s favorite ode to putting a good buzz on, \u201cShanty.\u201d And then, of course, there\u2019s the anthemic \u201cSunshine (Go Away Today),\u201d that fierce proclamation of protest and independence that resonated with thousands and thousands of frustrated and angry young men and women when it was first released in 1971. Almost 40 years later, at show after show, the song continues to be embraced by faithful followers and new fans alike.\nSince 1971, Jonathan has released 15 albums, including \"Blue Ridge,\" his standard-setting collaboration with bluegrass favorites the Seldom Scene, and \"Little Hands,\" his collection of children\u2019s songs, which was honored with a National Library Association award. His brand new album is, \"Tomorrow's Child.\"\nwww.jonathanedwards.net", "date": "2016-04-22T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Jonathan Edwards at Green Wood Coffee House"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/620213251459948/", "description": "BOARD+BREW: A2 No. 2 Eh Tu \nwhere: Ground Floor @ 327 Braun Court Kerrytown \nadmission: nothing \ndonation: zero \nbring: everyone!\n\n** New Library Games **\n\nFUSE -- it's amazing!\nDIAMONDS -- it's shiny!\nYardmaster Express -- it's fine!", "date": "2016-04-22T20:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Board Game Night at Bar Braun Court"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/935490533173037/", "description": "Big Wild\nw/ Aash Mehta & Azura Music\n\nFri.
