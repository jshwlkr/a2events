His style drew upon numerous international influences including, among others, Modernism and Surrealism. Although not strictly Surrealist, many of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s works manifest a similarly fantastical mood. One of the artist\u2019s most arresting qualities is his ability to imbue scenes of everyday life with an otherworldly, metaphysical power. The photographs in the exhibition, from UMMA\u2019s collections, show the artist using motifs drawn from Mexican religious and indigenous works as well as plant forms, in a Modernist approach to image making. UMMA docents will discuss these motifs and the artist\u2019s use of light as a metaphor and revealer of life, animating even the emptiest and most silent of \u00c1lvarez Bravo\u2019s scenes.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1665144867135831/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-18T18:30:00-04:00", "name": "Ann Arbor Poetry Slam", "description": "Ann Arbor Poetry Slam is back this Sunday with another all ages open community free-speech event!

Holding guards and civilian employees hostage, during the next four long days and nights the inmates negotiated with state officials for improved living conditions. On September 13, the state abruptly ended talks and sent many hundreds of heavily armed state troopers and corrections officers to retake the prison by force. In the ensuing gunfire, thirty-nine men were killed--hostages as well as prisoners--and close to one hundred were severely injured. Over the following hours, days, and weeks, troopers and officers brutally retaliated against the prisoners. For decades afterward, instead of charging any state employee who had committed murder or carried out egregious human rights abuses, New York officials only prosecuted the prisoners and failed to provide necessary support to the hostage survivors or the families of any of the men who'd been killed. \ufffd\ufffd     \n\nHeather Ann Thompson sheds new light on one of the most important civil rights stories of the last century, exploring every aspect of the uprising and its legacy from the perspectives of all of those involved in this forty-five year fight for justice: the prisoners, the state officials, the lawyers on both sides, the state troopers and corrections officers, and the families of the slain men.\n\nHeather Ann Thompson is an award-winning historian at the University of Michigan. She has written on the history of mass incarceration as well as its current impact for The New York Times, Time Magazine, The Atlantic, Salon, Dissent, New Labor Forum, and The Huffington Post. She served on a National Academy of Sciences blue-ribbon panel that studied the causes and consequences of mass incarceration in the United States and has given Congressional Staff briefings on this subject. Thompson is also the author of Whose Detroit: Politics, Labor and Race in a Modern American City and editor of Speaking Out: Protest and Activism in the 1960s and 1970s.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/245238912538964/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-20T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: James Cornelison", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\nJames Cornelison\nChicago Native James Cornelison has been working as a multi-instrumentalist in Michigan for 5 years.

UM Zell Fellow in Poetry Kayla Krut will open for Leila and Tracey.\n\nLeila Chatti is a Tunisian-American poet. She holds a BA from Michigan State University and an MFA from North Carolina State University. The recipient of a fellowship from the Fine Arts Work Center, a scholarship from the Tin House Writers\u2019 Workshop, and prizes from Narrative Magazine\u2019s 30 Below Contest, the Gregory O'Donoghue International Poetry Prize, and the Academy of American Poets, her poems appear in Best New Poets, Narrative, Boston Review, North American Review, The Missouri Review, TriQuarterly, Gulf Coast, and elsewhere. www.leilachatti.com\n\n*\n\nThe poems in Tracey Knapp's Mouth are about the world of the mouth and its many satellites. Words, especially. And when you're lucky, another mouth. The poems address the beautiful failures of language to mean what it says, and to be less than the physical. At the end of the day, you are left with only the words in your head, the mouth on your face.\n\n\"Quotidian, weird, intimate, witty, and skittery, Knapp's poems are refractions through a funhouse mirror. They're self-conscious without being self-important. The wounded heart is everywhere apparent; we of that tribe can be grateful for one more of us to voice it, brilliantly. MOUTH is a charmer of a first book. Read it and weep over your nachos and wine; it will leave you wanting more.\"\u2014Kim Addonizio\n\n\"...part Frank O\u2019Hara, part Robert Herrick ...it\u2019s a book that hurts, and a book that flirts... It\u2019s also part of the least self-important, and therefore the most important, tradition of lyric, the tradition of trying to make the tiny moments, their delights and disappointments, last.\"--Stephen Burt, Slate\n\n\"Deliciously irreverent, Knapp\u2019s poems welcome us into a weird urban landscape full of airports, broken hearts, wine and spilled dog chow. ...[She] delves into the shadow and still finds glimpses of light.\"--San Francisco Chronicle\n\nTracey Knapp's first full-length collection of poems, Mouth, won the 42 Miles Press Poetry Award and was published in 2015.
