[{"description": "Before joining the faculty of the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles, Mira Henry spent several years as a project architect, immersed in the everyday, banal details of how buildings get built: construction drawings, material specs, and building codes. She became an expert in seeing the world the way an architect sees it. But as a progressive architectural thinker, Henry\u2019s inspiration has been to deconstruct that vision, to \u201cunsee\u201d the very forms and representations that constitute an architect\u2019s basic language.\n\nThrough speculative experiments and conceptual drawings Henry discovers in static architectural details an unsettling range of figurative expression, including, for example, the way the profiles of roof eaves resemble human heads. Wallpaper, with its ability to mask, transform, or animate a space, is also a prominent element in her work. Her projects explore how these features animate our subjective experience\u2014what she calls our \u201cshifting fantasies\u201d\u2014of architectural space.\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment.", "date": "2016-07-09T11:00:00-04:00", "name": "Mira Henry: The View Inside", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/402661156571041/"}, {"description": "Multipurpose Room\n\nFree.

To win, not only does Raymie have to do good deeds and learn how to twirl a baton; she also has to contend with the wispy, frequently fainting Louisiana Elefante, who has a show-business background, and the fiery, stubborn Beverly Tapinski, who's determined to sabotage the contest.

Recording for the first time as a solo artist and writing without what he refers to as \"the shackles of genre\", the direction is really a culmination of the variety in his past projects. The sound is still very much grounded in American Roots music but is unbound by the narrow concepts he has applied to previous outings. \n\nRyan Racine first made a name for himself as the front man of Ann Arbor\u2019s rockabilly outfit Lucky Haskins. Formed when he was only 15, the band burst onto the metro Detroit rockabilly scene and quickly garnered attention and a loyal fan base. Besides introducing the genre to a whole new generation in the area, they earned spots opening for legends like Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Lee Rocker as well as a slot in the 1995 Detroit Music Awards.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "date": "2016-07-12T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Ryan Racine", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1556397304662788/"}]
