The weeklong tribute provides an opportunity for craft brewers to share their diversity, creativity and passion for the beverage they love with the greater craft beer community. From May 16 \u2013 22, all 50 states will be holding events including exclusive brewery tours, special craft beer releases, food and beer pairings, tap takeovers and more to celebrate the ever-advancing beer culture in the United States.\n \nABC is tapping a limited release brew each day to celebrate. \n\nMONDAY: New beer release!! \"Flower Assembly Pale Ale\" 6.2% ABV 35 IBU. Hopped entirely with Mosaic, the beer is loaded with citrus and tropical fruit character, with grassy and resinous notes in the background. \n\nTUESDAY:1/6bbl teaser of Sour Sacred Cow. Tart, bitter, and dry. Sneak peak of a new addition to our sour lineup before a full batch is tapped next week\n\nWEDNESDAY: Pin of Euchre Pils dry-hopped with whole flower Cascade. An extra flowery, zesty rendition of our classic pilsner. \n\nTHURSDAY: 1/6bbl teaser of Sour Michael Faricy Stout. Age has amplified the chocolate and roast character of this stout. The tartness isn't as intense as many of our sour offerings, but this brew delivers a complex, multi-dimensional brew. \n\nFRIDAY: Flower Assembly pin dry hopped in the cask with more Mosaic. This cask version is  little softer and nuanced, but with all the loveliness of the Mosaic hops. \n\nSATURDAY: 10 Blinks Cherry Saison - a well balanced, smooth summer sipper.

Her work has appeared in Guernica, The Prague Review, The Offing, The Rumpus, and been nominated for a Pushcart Prize. She worked in magazines, politics, and public relations in the U.K and her native New Zealand before moving to the U.S. She holds an MFA from Columbia College Chicago. In her debut essay collection, New Zealand native Toni Nealie examines journeys, homelands, family, and motherhood. She details humiliating confrontations with airport security, muses on the color brown, and intimately investigates her grandfather\u2019s complicated and criminal past, all while hearkening home\u2014wherever and whatever that is.\n\nZoe Zolbrod's work has appeared in Salon, The Nervous Breakdown, The Weeklings, and The Rumpus, where she serves as Sunday co-editor. Her debut novel Currency won a 2010 Nobbie Award and received an honorable mention by Friends of American Writers. Zolbrod lives in Evanston, Illinois, with her husband and children. About The Telling: Zoe Zolbrod remained silent about her early childhood molestation for nearly a decade. When she finally decided to tell, she wasn't sure what to expect, or what to say. Through a kaleidoscopic series of experiences as an adult, mother, and feminist, Zolbrod traces the development of her sexuality and her relationships with men in the shadow of her sexual abuse.", "name": "Toni Nealie & Zoe Zolbrod", "date": "2016-05-16T19:00:00-04:00"}]
