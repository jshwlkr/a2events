Blair will be joined in conversation by UM MFA alum Mindy Misener.\n\nBlair Braverman fell in love with the North at an early age: By the time she was nineteen, she had left her home in California, moved to Norway to learn how to drive sled dogs, and worked as a tour guide on a glacier in Alaska. By turns funny and sobering, bold and tender, Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube charts Blair\u2019s endeavor to become a \u201ctough girl\u201d\u2014someone who courts danger in an attempt to become fearless. As she ventures into a ruthless arctic landscape, Blair faces down physical exhaustion\u2014being buried alive in an ice cave, and driving a dogsled across the tundra through a whiteout blizzard in order to avoid corrupt police\u2014and grapples with both love and violence as she negotiates the complex demands of being a young woman in a man\u2019s land.\n\nBrilliantly original and bracingly honest, Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube captures the triumphs and the perils of the journey to self-discovery and independence in a landscape that is as beautiful as it is unforgiving.\n\nBlair Braverman graduated from the University of Iowa\u2019s Nonfiction Writing Program, where she was also an Arts Fellow.

He lives in Vermont.\n\nYou ve seen the headlines: Parmesan cheese made from sawdust. Lobster rolls containing no lobster at all. Extra-virgin olive oil that isn t. Fake foods are in our supermarkets, our restaurants, and our kitchen cabinets. Award-winning food journalist and travel writer Larry Olmsted exposes this pervasive and dangerous fraud perpetrated on unsuspecting Americans. \"Real Food/Fake Food\" brings readers into the unregulated food industry, revealing that this shocking deception extends from high-end foods like olive oil, wine, and Kobe beef to everyday staples such as coffee, honey, juice, and cheese. It's a massive bait and switch where counterfeiting is rampant and where the consumer ultimately pays the price. But Olmsted does more than show us what foods to avoid. A bona fide gourmand, he travels to the sources of the real stuff, to help us recognize what to look for, eat, and savor: genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy, fresh-caught grouper from Florida, authentic port from Portugal. Real foods that are grown, raised, produced, and prepared with care by masters of their craft. Part cautionary tale, part culinary crusade, \"Real Food/Fake Food\" is addictively readable, mouth-wateringly enjoyable, and utterly relevant.

In 2006, Dennen signed with Dualtone and released So Much More. Hope for the Hopeless followed on the same imprint in 2008. Dennen's fourth studio effort, Loverboy, which featured subtle African rhythms and more of a pop veneer, arrived in April of 2011, followed in 2013 by the sparser acoustic-based Smoke and Mirrors and 2014 \nrelease of Out of My Head.
