In 2014, after having self released a small handful of singles and two EPs on Bandcamp, Malvin signed to the taste making Sydney based label Future Classic. Under the new label, he rereleased Sparks EP and released the Goddess EP. His next EP, Parallelism is slated to be released with Future Classic on November 6.\n\nInspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers. FADER has described his music as \u2018form-shifting beats [that] seem to resonate with spaced-out chillers and hyperactive party kids alike\u2019.\n\nIn 2012, while on Warped Tour as the drummer for Stepdad, Malvin released the slow burning, bass heavy single \u201cMarijuana\u201d on a Bandcamp compilation highlighting music from he and his friends in Ann Arbor. It quickly rocketed to #1 on Hype Machine and has since become an internet-stoner anthem. It has subsequently been rereleased by Future Classic and Kitsun\u00e9.", "date": "2016-09-14T09:00:00-04:00", "name": "Chrome Sparks wsg Roland Tings 9/14/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/176948129391837/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "ABC's Mitten Made Beer Tasting\nJoin us on Wednesday, September 14 to explore why Michigan IS the great beer state!\n\nWe will revel in the best of the best in our Great Beer State.

Children of the New World grapples with our unease in this modern world and how our ever-growing dependence on new technologies has changed the shape of our society. Alexander Weinstein is a visionary new voice in speculative fiction for all of us who are fascinated by and terrified of what we might find on the horizon.\n\n\ufffd\"Taken together, these stories present a fully-imagined vision of the future which will disturb you, provoke you, and make you feel alive.

Not your typical sports memoir, Chasing Water also contains arresting black-and-white drawings and a graphic story extra, as well as an inventive and mercurial narrative style that morphs chapter by chapter to reflect Ervin\u2019s restless, multifaceted life. Ervin won a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games at the age of nineteen. He is an athlete branded with a slew of titles including being the first US Olympic swimmer of African American descent, along with Jewish heritage, who also grew up with Tourette\u2019s syndrome. He shocked the sporting world by retiring soon after claiming two world titles following the 2000 Olympics. Auctioning off his gold medal for charity, he set off on a part spiritual quest, part self-destructive bender that involved Zen temples, fast motorcycles, tattoo parlors, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands. Then Ervin resurfaced in 2012 to not only make the US Olympic team twelve years after his first appearance, but to continue his career by swimming faster than ever before, and faster than anyone else. \n\n\"Here Ervin and swim trainer and journalist Markides combine talents to create a biography that is part first-hand narrative by Ervin, with Markides filling in the details and providing context. The formula works, pulling readers into Ervin's experience of the thrill of victory and search for meaning....Featuring more depth, breadth, truth, and the effects of reckless choices than found in traditional athlete biographies, this gripping account is just in time for the gear up to the Rio 2016 Olympics. Readers will understand the psyche and life of elite athletes as never before, then cheer Ervin on in his attempt to make another Olympic team.\"--Library Journal\n\n\"A celebrated Olympian recounts how he rose to the top of his sport, crashed, and found redemption....This book, which tells his story through a narrative that interweaves the former gold medalist's memories with commentary by his friend and colleague Markides, reveals the extreme highs and lows that characterized Ervin's remarkable life and career....The author never flinches at revealing his less-than-perfect past, and the humility he demonstrates at coming to terms with his own egotism and personal shortcomings makes the book frequently compelling. A provocative and refreshingly honest redemption memoir.\"--Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"Markides smartly combines his own journalistic account with a parallel narrative in which Ervin...explains his life and style. Some talents simply defy explanation, however, and Ervin may be in that category....The story of his comeback at 31 (ancient for a swimmer) is rendered more amazing by the contrast with what went before.\"--Booklist \n\n\"Most memoirs from Olympians are puff pieces, ghost-written so blandly you fall asleep trying to make it to the end of the first chapter. Chasing Water is the opposite of that, an intimate, visceral experience you will appreciate.\"--SwimSwam \n\n\"A refreshingly unexpected athlete biography void of eye-rolling, cliched, self help propaganda bullshit.\"--Gary Hall, Jr., swimmer, ten-time Olympic medalist", "date": "2016-09-15T19:00:00-04:00", "name": "Anthony Ervin & Constantine Markides"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1186311131413949/", "source": "Facebook", "description": "Thursday, September 15 | 9pm | 18+ | $15 Cover\n\nGold Panda wsg: Open Mike Eagle\n\nThe story of Gold Panda\u2019s journey from an acclaimed debut record to now, as he prepares to release his third full length album, is an entirely circular one. Hailing from Chelmsford Essex in the UK, in the six years since the release of his genre-defining debut album \u2018Lucky Shiner\u2019, the electronic artist most comfortable with the moniker Derwin Panda spent the subsequent years splitting the majority of his time between London, Berlin and countless excursions to Japan. As he created his third album \u2018\u2019Good Luck And Do Your Best\u2019 he ultimately found himself back where he began, in the East of England.\n\nOrigin stories can be fundamentally boring by nature, packed with non-essential details and overly stressed homilies to roots and influences. But the core nature of an artist that has produced some of the most beloved and emotionally-infused electronic music of this decade is deeply rooted in the constant desire to return to where his musical world began.\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/710", "date": "2016-09-15T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Gold Panda w/ Open Mike Eagle 9/15/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor"}]
