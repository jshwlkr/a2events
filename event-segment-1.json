I am a junior at Community High School in Ann Arbor Michigan. I have been playing the violin for six years. My primary school does not have an orchestra program, therefore, I attend Huron High School to play in their Symphony Orchestra. \n\nGetting to Symphony orchestra took a lot of hardwork and dedication. As a freshman, I began in the Philharmonic Orchestra in which I received the Most Improved Award. That year I auditioned and  advanced into Concert Orchestra. In my  sophomore year, I again auditioned and advanced into Symphony Orchestra,  which I am currently in. Most recently I was selected to to be a part of  Huron's pit orchestra for their production of \u201cGuys and Dolls.\u201d\n\nEach year I participate in the MSBOA solo and ensemble. I received all 1's in both solo and quartet for all three years. I have taken private lessons at the Community Music School of Ann Arbor since I began playing the violin in 2010. For the last five years I have attended Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp and Interlochen Music Camp for two years.\n\nABOUT ME\nI am extremely dedicated to music, God, and family. When I go to college I plan to study Music Education and/or Composition. I come from a musical family. I have two amazing parents, three siblings, and three awesome cats. My brother plays the trumpet in his school jazz band, my mother a Jazz vocalist and my two older sisters are in college; one of which studies music at Washtenaw Community College.  In my spare time I enjoy drawing, watching movies, attending my Girls Group(a mentoring group for teens), yearbook club and listening to classical music. In addition, I volunteer to mentor music students at my former middle school, Scarlett Junior High.\n\nBlue Lakes International Exchange Program 2016\nIn the summer of  2013, while at Blue Lake, I auditioned and was accepted into the Blue Lake International Exchange Program. This would be an experience that would allow me to travel Europe with the orchestra and perform in amazing concert halls. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to attend due to family financial reasons. \n\nThis year I was again invited to participate in the exchange program. Being that this will be my last eligible year to attend, I humbly am asking for your financial support.  Details about this trip can be found here.   \n\nFUNDRAISING GOALS\n The departure date is June 19th, 2016 and a return date of July 14th, 2016. My fundraising goal is $6,800 due in full by end of May 2016.  This will cover travel, uniforms, sheet music,  international tours, tickets, passport, housing and more. \n\nTo help raise the funds needed I will be giving mini recitals to be announced, personal fundraising pages, candy sales and a donation jar located at Blackstone Bookstore & Cultural Center located at 214 W. Michigan Ave, Ypsilanti MI 48197. I\u2019ll also be willing to play for any local events upon request. \n\nYou may also send contributions directly to Blue Lake to be credited to my personal account (non-tax deductible).To ensure funds are channeled to proper accounts please follow these procedures: If paying by check, please make checks payable to Blue Lake International Exchange Program or Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp. My name must appear in the memo line of check and touring Ensemble.  For more information, contact the Blue Lake International Office at (800)221-3796 or email international@bluelake.org.\n\nI am truly thankful for any and all contributions made towards my trip and upon returning you will be invited to attend a free concert at Hill Auditorium TBA. I will also provide photos of this once in a lifetime experience for me.\n\nwith Sincere Gratitude,\n\nNadia E.

The Wolverine State has been the birthplace, home, and inspiration to a tremendous number of men and women of letters, both the well-known and the obscure. Ink Trails II tells the stories of these fascinating and diverse writers whose talent is inextricably linked to Michigan.Exploring the hidden treasures of otherwise forgotten authors while also acknowledging the Michigan-set stories of giants like Hemingway, Dave and Jack Dempsey delve into the state\u2019s literary heritage, as robust, diverse, and inexhaustible as the natural beauty of the place that nurtured it. This second volume of \u201cink trails\u201d continues to tell the story of the remarkable writers, powerful words, and sublime nature of Michigan in the same well-researched and entertaining prose as the first.\n\nAbout Yamasaki in Detroit: Although his best-known project was the World Trade Center in New York City, Japanese American architect Minoru Yamasaki (1912\u20131986) worked to create moments of surprise, serenity, and delight in distinctive buildings around the world. In his adopted home of Detroit, where he lived and worked for the last half of his life, Yamasaki produced many important designs that range from public buildings to offices and private residences. In Yamasaki in Detroit: A Search for Serenity, author John Gallagher presents both a biography of Yamasaki\u2014or Yama as he was known\u2014and an examination of his working practices, with an emphasis on the architect\u2019s search for a style that would express his artistic goals. Both knowledgeable fans of modernist architecture and general readers will enjoy Yamasaki in Detroit.\n\nAbout The Orbit Magazine Anthology: With a mischievous globe-headed mascot that appeared in every issue and even on Quentin Tarantino\u2019s T-shirt in Pulp Fiction, Orbit was an instantly recognizable arbiter of 1990s Detroit culture. But its irreverent tone and unique editorial features could be traced to two earlier local publications from creator Jerry Peterson, a.k.a. Jerry Vile\u2014White Noise (1978\u20131980) and Fun: The Magazine for Swinging Intelectuals [sic] (1986\u20131990). In The Orbit Magazine Anthology: Re-Entry, author Rob St. Mary details the full run of White Noise, Fun, and Orbit, collecting two decades\u2019 worth of Detroit\u2019s alternative publishing history into an oversized, heavily illustrated volume that situates the publications in the city\u2019s pop culture and media history. Anyone interested in Detroit arts and culture or the history of alternative publishing will be grateful for The Orbit Magazine Anthology.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, May 2, 2016 - 7:00pm", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1100713003313165/", "date": "2016-05-02T19:00:00-04:00"}]
