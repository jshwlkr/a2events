Filmmaker Jen Proctor will explore the paranormal communication and hear voiiiiiices from beyond - or at least, what believers claim are voices from beyond. Sara Wedell, who has read Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s Little House books more times than you have, will reveal the sinister side on the prairie - a family of serial killers preying on pioneers. And superHERoes Chelsea Liddy and Amanda Reyes Aquino of Comique Con will talk about the evolving roles of women in the world of comics. So put on your smarty-pants glasses and come on out to raise a few beer glasses!\n \nWhen: Thursday, October 20, 2016, doors at 6:30 pm, talks at 7 pm!\nWhere: LIVE, 102 S First St, Ann Arbor\n$$$: Free, thanks to your friendly neighborhood AADL!\n\n\nJen Proctor: Talking to the Dead: A History of Spirit Communication Technologies - Jen Proctor\n\nFrom the telegraph to mobile apps, from Poltergeist's televisual ghouls toUnfriended's possessed Skype sessions, from EVPs to spirit photography, this talk will explore the history of attempts to communicate with the dead using electric and electronic technologies. We'll see and hear terrifying and not-so-terrifying evidence of spectral messages, and examine what exactly constitutes evidence for investigators of the paranormal. GHOSTLY CAT VIDEOS WILL BE INCLUDED!\n\nAbout Jen: Proctor is a filmmaker, media artist, and Associate Professor of Journalism and Screen Studies at UM-Dearborn. She is currently working on a documentary about the relationship between technology, the paranormal, and spiritual belief. In her spare time, she studies abnormal feline behavior.\n\n\nSara Wedell: Little Slaughterhouse on the Prairie\n\nFrontier life in the 1870s was hard and the massive prairie held endless dangers - aside from the harsh elements, the grueling work, and the salt pork-heavy diet. This is the sinister side of Little House on the Prairie - the true story of a family of serial killers targeting pioneers on their way out West.\n\nAbout Sara: Sara Wedell is a production librarian at the Ann Arbor District Library and a Nerd Nite Ann Arbor Co-Boss. She knows it\u2019s not cool to love Laura Ingalls Wilder, BUT SHE DOES IT ANYWAY. #sunbonnetsquad\n\n\nChelsea Liddy and Amanda Reyes Aquino: A History of Women in Comics\n\nWe'll discuss how women's roles in and in creating comic books have evolved over the past 100 or so years, as well as how things are changing and the future that Comique Con is helping to create.\n\nAbout Chelsea, Amanda, and Comique Con: ComiqueCon is a one-day celebration of the contributions of women to the sequential arts. Launched in 2015 in Metro Detroit, the event brings together comics all-stars and their fans for a wicked awesome day of comics and cosplay! Prior year featured guests have included Alex de Campi, Mikki Kendall, Marguerite Sauvage, Carey Pietsch, Nancy A. Collins and Mairghread Scott. In an industry that consistently under-solicits women, we\u2019re spotlighting the work of women in comics and encouraging representation and inclusiveness.", "name": "Specters, Serial Killers, & SuperHERos"}, {"date": "2016-10-20T19:00:00-04:00", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1141271379301130/", "description": "This event will take place on our main floor.\n\nLiterati and the University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School are pleased to welcome Rackham alumna Melanie Sinche to discuss her latest book, Next Gen PhD: A Guide to Career Paths in Science.\n\nFor decades, top scientists in colleges and universities pursued a clear path to success: enroll in a prestigious graduate program, conduct research, publish papers, complete the PhD, pursue postdoctoral work. With perseverance and a bit of luck, a tenure-track professorship awaited at the end. In today\u2019s academic job market, this scenario represents the exception. As the number of newly conferred science PhDs keeps rising, the number of tenured professorships remains stubbornly stagnant. Only 14 percent of those with PhDs in science occupy tenure-track positions five years after completing their degree.\n\nNext Gen PhD provides a frank and up-to-date assessment of the current career landscape facing science PhDs. Nonfaculty careers once considered Plan B are now preferred by the majority of degree holders, says Melanie Sinche. An upper-level science degree is a prized asset in the eyes of many employers, and a majority of science PhDs build rewarding careers both inside and outside the university. A certified career counselor with extensive experience working with graduate students and postdocs, Sinche offers step-by-step guidance through the career development process: identifying personal strengths and interests, building work experience and effective networks, assembling job applications, and learning tactics for interviewing and negotiating\u2014all the essentials for making a successful career transition.\n\nSinche profiles science PhDs across a wide range of disciplines who share proven strategies for landing the right occupation. Current graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, mentors, and students considering doctoral and postdoctoral training in the sciences will find Next Gen PhD an empowering resource.\n\nMelanie V.
