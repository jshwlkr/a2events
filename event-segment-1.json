[{"description": "How do you use computer-controlled (\u201cCNC\u201d) tools?  It may look like magic when the ShopBot, plasma cutter, Tormach, or other machine accurately cuts an intricate shape, but in fact we have some powerful software tools that  let even beginners create fantastic projects.\n\nThis class is an overview of \u201cCNC\u201d\u2013that is, computer controlled machines.  You\u2019ll learn what CAD means, the difference between 2D and 3D, and other concepts.  We will do some very simple hands-on activities, including creating a drawing in a CAD program, using a CAM program to generate code to run on a CNC machine, and each person will send their job to a simple CNC machine and see it run!\n\nIf you have no CNC experience, this would be a great class to take before checkout classes for specific CNC machines. \n\nThere is no prerequisite for this class, but familiarity with using software on a computer will be needed\u2013things like clicking with the mouse and so on.\n\nNotes and other handouts will be provided.\n\nBe sure to check out our CNC toolchain map (which we\u2019ll explain in class) and CNC glossary at http://maker-works.com/cadcam-toolchain/\n\n1 class: 1.5 hours\nClass size: 4 people\n$25\n\nPlease arrive 10 minutes early if this is your first time to Maker Works.\nCall Maker Works at 734-222-4911 or visit http://www.supersaas.com/schedule/makerworks/CheckOut?day=24&month=10&year=2016&view=day to sign up!", "date": "2016-10-24T15:00:00-04:00", "name": "Intro to CNC", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1105739719547225/"}, {"description": "Come make an awesome fascinator with our hat enthusiast Je\u2019Tone.

Michele will be joined in conversation by Jennifer Friess, the assistant curator of photography at the UMMA: University of Michigan Museum of Art.\n\nWith the oceans covering over 70 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface, our planet can be called a marine planet. Beneath the waves are millions of remarkable creatures\u2014beautiful big whales, dangerous jellyfish, legions of phytoplankton\u2014but also, perhaps least known, are the marine invertebrates who make up an essential part of marine life. At the University of Miami, Florida, one museum is devoted to the study of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific marine invertebrates\u2014over 93,000 specimens. Many of them were pulled from the Gulf of Panama, throughout the Caribbean, the Florida Keys, and the eastern Pacific over the last fifty years. They represent creatures that may never be seen again as the oceans grow ever more polluted and as global warming wreaks havoc on these ecosystems. Here, in lavishly beautifully photographs, nearly 100 of the rarest, most wondrous, mystifying, and entrancing specimens are brought into the light. From rare seahorses to now extinct corals, these invertebrates leave one gasping again at the extraordinary beauty and mystery of our world.\n\nMichele Oka Doner is an internationally renowned artist whose career spans four decades. The breadth of her artistic production encompasses sculpture, furniture, jewelry, public art, functional objects, video, as well as costume and set design. She is well-known for creating numerous public art installations throughout the United States, including Radiant Site at New York's Herald Square subway, Flight at Washington's Reagan International Airport, and A Walk on the Beach at the Miami International Airport. Her artwork can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Louvre, the Yale Art Gallery, the Princeton University Art Museum, and many others.

It\u2019s a naturally-born but dedicatedly-finessed skill that has led him to collaborate with artists as diverse as Plan B, Sheryl Crow and Rudimental, synced his music on multiple TV shows ranging from Grey\u2019s Anatomy to the finale of Sons Of Anarchy, and caught the ears of some of the biggest players (in every sense) in music, from Elton John to Ed Sheeran. \n\nSo it is that in the run-up to the release of his new album, Vance travelled to Nashville. It\u2019s a long way from home for the Irishman, both from the place of his birth (Bangor, Northern Ireland) and the place of his residence (Aberfeldy, Scotland). But for an inveterate songwriter, Music City is an irresistible draw, a place where Vance can work with the best of the best. Not, Vance clarifies, for himself or his own material. For one thing, he\u2019s already completed his new album, and with songs of the calibre and single-minded brilliance of the dozen that comprise The Wild Swan, there\u2019s no need for any outside assistance. \n\nWSG: Trevor Sensor\n\nhttp://www.blindpigmusic.com/calendar.html#!/events/681", "date": "2016-10-25T21:00:00-04:00", "name": "Foy Vance w/ Trevor Sensor 10/25/16 at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor", "source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1158475607517012/"}, {"description": "Artistic Director Shawn McDonald and other Arbor Opera Theater artists will perform Broadway favorites.\nTickets may be purchased online for the concert and the luncheon that follows.
