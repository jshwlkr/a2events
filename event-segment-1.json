The pieces will be altered and built upon to demonstrate how she makes pots and thinks about design and function. The workshop will also focus on surface design and embellishment using slip trailing, carving and line drawing. Silvie is deeply engaged in practice of making functional pots and the theater and atmosphere of the dining experience. Silvie states: \u201cI am interested in discussing how we learn techniques, develop ideas and evolve as innovators rather than imitators. Ideas come easily, but meaning seems to come in layers over decades of time. It is meaning that gives strength to good ideas.\u201d Silvie invites participants to bring images of their work for discussion and questions and themes that we might discuss and all benefit from. How we evolve as makers in our increasingly technological world is a favorite topic of mine.\n\nSilvie Granatelli received her BFA from Kansas City Art Institute and her MFA from Montana State University. Since 1982 she has maintained a home and studio in Floyd, Virginia. Granatelli exhibits her work throughout the United States. She is a seasoned workshop presenter and teacher having taught students in colleges and art centers throughout the US and abroad.\n\nPlease take a moment to watch this interview with Silvie that is available on her website:\nhttp://silviegranatelli.com/interview/\nView less", "source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-10-08T09:30:00-04:00", "name": "Ceramics Workshop: Sylvie Granatelli"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/749295545208940/", "description": "Join us for Intuitives Interactive's 4th Annual FALL HOLISTIC & PSYCHIC EXPO!
