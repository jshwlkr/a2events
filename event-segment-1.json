Nesta Spink, curator at UMMA from 1967 to 1979, is regarded as the preeminent authority on the lithographs of James McNeill Whistler. U-M professor emeritus Walter Spink is a world-renowned specialist on early Buddhist art and architecture in India. This selection of their gifts, exhibited together for the first time, provides insight into the minds of two connoisseurs with tastes that range far beyond their areas of specialization; highlights include exquisite Whistler prints that are rarely on display and a rich representation of South Asian folk art. The Connoisseurs\u2019 Legacy also honors the Spinks\u2019 long relationship with the Museum, their roles as teachers of future scholars and curators, and their commitment to public education.\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost.
