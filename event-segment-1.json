An accomplished instrumentalist, she began playing the classical guitar at 11. Influenced by edIT, Bonobo, The Widdler and Amon Tobin, she started producing electronic music at the age of 16.\n\nIn 2014, she won the 'Best International Newcomer of 2013' at the UK Glitch-Hop Award.\n\nHer tracks defy genres, oscillating between World Bass, Tribal Trap, Glitch-Hop, Trip-Hop, and Downtempo. She created her own place in the glitch community, thanks to a unique, highly surprising style, mixing powerful basslines, funky off beat percussion and emotional cinematic sounds. A musical identity which led her to play in the USA (including the festivals Coachella, Lightning In A Bottle, Shambhala...), Canada, India, Berlin, and more than 30 cities in France, alongside artists like Bonobo, Gramatik, Chet Faker, Tipper, TOKiMONSTA, Tipper, Big Gigantic, GRiZ...\n\nRunner-up of several remix contests (launched by artists like Mr. Bill, Asian Trash Boy, Crazy Daylight, Daenine...), CloZee was spotted by respected labels such as Gravitas Recordings, Glitch Hop Community, Adapted Records, Digital Whomp, Empathy Recordings, MOR Records, Waxhole Records\u2026 \n\nWebsite - http://www.clozeemusic.com/\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/clozee\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/CloZee \n\nPsymbionic\nCresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound.\n\nJohn Burcham has been moving bodies and turning heads as Psymbionic for several years in all corners of the USA, playing with acts such as Bassnectar, STS9, Big Gigantic, ill.Gates, Excision, EOTO, and Tipper. His passion and innovation in the music world are showcased through album releases on Muti Music and MalLabel, as well as in his role as label manager for the popular Electronic imprint Gravitas Recordings.\n\nIn a live show context, Psymbionic confronts mixes that are limited to the scope of the build and release, avoiding an industry epidemic of drop-monotony that overpowers the flow of music. Burcham seeks to prove that there are more powerful influences in moving a crowd than simple tension, providing an interwoven dynamic that relies on the strength of his blend, rather than the sole force or familiarity of the apex.\n\nPsymbionic's theory of music is a journey that doesn't visit the same place twice, building excitement for what's next not because you can anticipate it, but because you've never been there before.\n\nWebsite - http://www.psymbionicmusic.com/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/psymbionic\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/psymbionic", "date": "2016-12-15T21:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "CloZee & Psymbionic - Biohackers Tour at Necto - 12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/558399577690989/", "description": "Unwind from the workweek and flex your creative muscles while enjoying our exclusive Pointless craft beers. \n\nWe will provide the writing and drawing prompts, doodle starters, colored pencils and markers, you provide your awesome self and your desire to relax and have fun.\n\nFridays, 3-7pm at Pointless Brewery & Theatre. 3014 Packard Road, Ann Arbor.", "date": "2016-12-16T15:00:00-05:00", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Drink & Draw / Imbibe & Inscribe"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/241191552964337/", "description": "Bring your well-worn items that could use a tune up, and we'll take a look at them! \n\nOr, make someone else's day by volunteering at Fix-It Friday and repairing their items.\n\nFix-It Friday:\nThink of this as the last chance before you get rid of something; Free, but no Guarantee.\n\nWe will:\n- try to diagnose what is wrong\n- tell you if we think we may be able to fix it today\n- tell you if you'll need a part, and where you might be able to get it\n- try to fix it to the best of our ability, but in the limited time we have\n\nHowever, we may not be able to fix it.
