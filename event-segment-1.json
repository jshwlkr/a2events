Dr. Givings treats women for hysteria, and now, thanks to the invention of electricity, he has a new vibrating instrument which is getting amazing results.  On just the other side of the door in the living room, his wife Catherine struggles with her role as a wife and mother.  Each of them is beginning to wonder, and worry, about exactly what is happening in the next room.  Loosen your corset and join Ann Arbor Civic Theatre for a play full of both poetry and farce that asks whether we are so different today.\n \nDirector Melissa Freilich is working with a talented ensemble of actors and designers to develop the world of the doctor\u2019s home.  Describing the emotional impact of the show, she says, \u201cThis play brings us into the character's lives.  We don't see what we expect from a Victorian stereotype.  Instead, we recognize real people who are struggling with their own feelings, in a way that's both beautiful and often really funny.\u201d\n \nThe artistic staff of In the Next Room, or the vibrator play includes set designer Leo Babcock, set dressing designer Beth Duey, props designer Aaron Wade, lighting designer Brad Pritts, costume designers Jamee Zielke and Abby Zielke, undergarments designer Molly Borneman, and sound designer Matt Steward.  The talented cast includes Greg Kovas as Dr. Givings, Liana Abela as Mrs. Givings, Amanda Photenhauer as Mrs. Daldry, Ellen Blanchard as Annie, Joseph McDonald as Leo, Maegan Murphy as Elizabeth and Rob Roy as Mr. Daldry.
