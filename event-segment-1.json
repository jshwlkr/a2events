This event is sponsored by the Michigan Humanities Council and is free and open to the public.\n\nStation Eleven is an audacious, darkly glittering novel about art, fame, and ambition set in the eerie days of civilization's collapse. One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time\u2014from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as The Travelling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains\u2014this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet. Sometimes terrifying, sometimes tender, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it.\n\nEmily St. John Mandel is the author of four novels, most recently Station Eleven, which was a finalist for a National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award, and won the 2015 Arthur C. Clarke Award. A previous novel, The Singer's Gun, was the 2014 winner of the Prix Mystere de la Critique in France.

May 11 | 9pm | 18+ | $20 Cover\n\nHailing from Oakland, California, Del the Funky Homosapien and his crew, the Hieroglyphics came out as a markedly non-gangster response to a burgeoning West Coast scene. After being put on at the tender age of 17 by his cousin Ice Cube, Del released two records on Elektra, I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991) and No Need For Alarm (1993). Despite record sales in the hundreds of thousands, he recorded a third album, Future Development, which was never commercially released. Del parted with Elektra and started work on the Hieroglyphics..family album, 3rd Eye Vision (Hiero Imperium, 1998). Hiero went on the road and toured incessantly in support of the album for much of 1998. Del also spent a good portion of his time drawing, practicing Japanese, and playing mass amounts of video games. Finally ready to unleash a new record on the world, Del comes with BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. Seventeen tracks of pure Del. He says of his work on this album: ..\"I've had complete control\". At times, Del has felt restrained by the formulas in hip hop and the expectations fans place upon emcees who have had hits. I wish that I had the same freedom that someone like Bjork has when she puts out an album..Apart from collaborations with PrincePaul, El-P (Company Flow), and help from a few of his Hiero cohorts (A-plus, Casual, Domino) Del handled the majority of production on this album. By staying true to himself, Del has earned legions of adoring fans. He may have said it best in his classic, Mistadobalina when he declared all in the mind and the heart.

The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality. When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to \u201ccure\u201d him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness. By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, this memoir is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.\n\n\u201cBoy Erased is an essential document of the early 21st Century. Conley bears witness to something history will eventually condemn as too horrible to have happened, but he also takes the pain of \u2018ex-gay therapy\u2019 and makes of it not just a record but a wonder.\u201d\u2014Alexander Chee, author of The Queen of the Night\n\n\u201cThis brave and bracing memoir is an urgent reminder that America remains a place where queer people have to fight for their lives. It\u2019s also a generous portrait of a family in which the myths of prejudice give way before the reality of love. Equal parts sympathy and rage, Boy Erased is a necessary, beautiful book.\u201d \u2014Garth Greenwell, author of What Belongs to You\n\n\u201cGarrard Conley's memoir about the author\u2019s time in the ex-gay movement is actually about surviving an attempt at soul-murder. The author has given us a clear and beautifully written account of what he went through. This is a book that had to be written, and it deserves a wide audience.\u201d\u2014Charles Baxter, author of The Feast of Love\n\n\u201cIn 1982, Edmund White broke literary ground with his memoir A Boy\u2019s Own Story. Now it\u2019s Garrard Conley\u2019s turn to bring his own story to readers. Conley is brave and honest in his depiction of growing up gay in conservative Christian America. As White was three decades ago for his generation, Conley is an important and necessary contemporary voice.\u201d\u2014Ann Hood, author of The Knitting Circle and Comfort\n\n\u201cA brave account of a young many coming to terms with his sexuality in an environment that reviles him for it. A triumphant, heart-felt story.\u201d \u2014Julia Scheeres, author of Jesus Land\n\nGarrard Conley\u2019s fiction and nonfiction can be found in The Common, The Madison Review, Spork, and elsewhere. He was a finalist for Narrative Magazine\u2019s Winter 2013 story contest.
