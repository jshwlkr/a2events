Katie will be joined in conversation by Natalie Bakopoulos, author of The Green Shore.\n\nA young woman has agreed with her faithless husband: it\u2019s time for them to separate. For the moment it\u2019s a private matter, a secret between the two of them. As she begins her new life, she gets word that Christopher has gone missing in a remote region in the rugged south of Greece; she reluctantly agrees to go look for him, still keeping their split to herself. In her heart, she\u2019s not even sure if she wants to find him. As her search comes to a shocking breaking point, she discovers she understands less than she thought she did about her relationship and the man she used to love. \n\nA searing, suspenseful story of intimacy and infidelity, A Separation lays bare the gult that divides us from the inner lives of others. With exquisitely cool precision, Katie Kitamura propels us into the experience of a woman on edge, with a fiercely mesmerizing story to tell.\n\n\u201cA slow burn of a novel that gathers its great force and intensity through careful observation and a refusal to accept old, shopworn narratives of love and loss.\u201d \u2014Jenny Offill, author of Dept. of Speculation\n\n\u201cA novel so seamless, that follows its path with such consequence, that even minor deviations seem loaded with meaning. Wonderful.\u201d \u2014Karl Ove Knausgaard, author of My Struggle\n\n\u201cThe burnt landscape, the disappearance of a man, the brilliantly cold, precise, and yet threatening, churning tone of the narrator\u2014make A Separation an absolutely mesmerizing work of art.\u201d \u2014Rachel Kushner, author of The Flamethrowers\n\n\u201cProfound and gripping. I had that rare sense of feeling like I was in a creation specifically made out of words, that couldn\u2019t have been made out of any other substance. Kitamura combines the calm complexity of Joseph Conrad with the pacing and reveal of Patricia Highsmith. This novel is a wonder and a pleasure.\u201d \u2014Rivka Galchen, author of Atmospheric Disturbances and Little Labors\n\n\u201cA Separation opens up fissures of ambiguity in emotional experiences too often misunderstood as monolithic\u2014grief, desire, estrangement\u2014and plumbs these crevices for all their complexities. It has both urgency and afterglow: I read it quickly, but didn\u2019t stop thinking about it for a long time once I was done.\u201d \u2014Leslie Jamison, author of The Empathy Exams\n\nKatie Kitamura is a critic and novelist living in New York City. She is the author of Gone to the Forest and The Longshot, both of which were finalists for the New York Public Library\u2019s Young Lions Fiction Award. A recipient of a Lannan Residency Fellowship, Kitamura has written for The New York Times, The Guardian, Granta, BOMB, Triple Canopy, and is a regular contributor to Frieze.\n\nEvent date: \nMonday, February 13, 2017 - 7:00pm\nEvent address: \nLiterati Bookstore\n124 E.
