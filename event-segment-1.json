Kids of many ages are welcome to attend. Free and open to the public.\n\nAbout the book: There is nothing sweeter than arriving at the playground, seeing it empty, and knowing you have it all to yourself--the silent comfort of playing alone. Maggie is overjoyed to have that solitude to make her Salad Pie. But then Herbert saunters over and wants to play too. \"I'm making salad. Salad Pie. And don't you touch it!\" Herbert just wants to help, even though Maggie makes it clear she won't let him. Then her imaginary pie takes a spill, and she realizes Herbert's intentions are not so bad after all.\n\nWendy BooydeGraaff grew up making mud pies on a fruit farm in Ontario, Canada. She now lives in Michigan with her family, where she whips up all kinds of salads and all kinds of pies.\n\nEvent date: \nSaturday, May 7, 2016 - 11:00am", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1566275347035929/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "Story Time with Wendy Booydegraff"}, {"date": "2016-05-07T11:00:00-04:00", "description": "Of COURSE you're buying flowers for your mother this Mother's Day weekend, and we're here to wrap them for you for free!
