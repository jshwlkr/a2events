[{"description": "From epicraces.com: You\u2019re no weekend running hobbyist. You\u2019re the real deal. Other people\u2019s workouts are your warm up. Wind, rain, snow, and darkness don\u2019t faze you: just point you at a trail, mount you on a bike, aim you at a lake and you\u2019re ready to roll. You eat miles for breakfast. You\u2019ve been waiting for the Michigan triathlon that\u2019s just as tough as you.  And now it\u2019s here: the Ann Arbor Triathlon, presented by the Wolverine State Brewing Company. No maize and blue. No adamantium claws. Just you and nature, baby\u2026 and beer at the finish line. Rock on!\n\nThe 2016 Ann Arbor Triathlon will be held on Sunday, August 7, 2016 at Halfmoon Lake in the Pinckney State Recreation Area, one of the largest state parks in all of Michigan. You\u2019ll swim the open waters of Halfmoon, bike the rolling country roads of the surrounding rural area, then run the 5-mile classic Poto Trail course to complete your mission: showing the world that you\u2019re a rock star.\n\nTo register and for more information, go to epicraces.com!", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1034739496621459/", "source": "Facebook", "name": "WolverineMan: The Ann Arbor Tri", "date": "2016-08-07T07:30:00-04:00"}, {"description": "We'll have our super fresh, flavorful, delicious tacos for you, just 3/$5.
