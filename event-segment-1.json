UM Zell Fellow in Poetry Kayla Krut will open for Leila and Tracey.\n\nLeila Chatti is a Tunisian-American poet. She holds a BA from Michigan State University and an MFA from North Carolina State University. The recipient of a fellowship from the Fine Arts Work Center, a scholarship from the Tin House Writers\u2019 Workshop, and prizes from Narrative Magazine\u2019s 30 Below Contest, the Gregory O'Donoghue International Poetry Prize, and the Academy of American Poets, her poems appear in Best New Poets, Narrative, Boston Review, North American Review, The Missouri Review, TriQuarterly, Gulf Coast, and elsewhere. www.leilachatti.com\n\n*\n\nThe poems in Tracey Knapp's Mouth are about the world of the mouth and its many satellites. Words, especially. And when you're lucky, another mouth. The poems address the beautiful failures of language to mean what it says, and to be less than the physical. At the end of the day, you are left with only the words in your head, the mouth on your face.\n\n\"Quotidian, weird, intimate, witty, and skittery, Knapp's poems are refractions through a funhouse mirror. They're self-conscious without being self-important. The wounded heart is everywhere apparent; we of that tribe can be grateful for one more of us to voice it, brilliantly. MOUTH is a charmer of a first book. Read it and weep over your nachos and wine; it will leave you wanting more.\"\u2014Kim Addonizio\n\n\"...part Frank O\u2019Hara, part Robert Herrick ...it\u2019s a book that hurts, and a book that flirts... It\u2019s also part of the least self-important, and therefore the most important, tradition of lyric, the tradition of trying to make the tiny moments, their delights and disappointments, last.\"--Stephen Burt, Slate\n\n\"Deliciously irreverent, Knapp\u2019s poems welcome us into a weird urban landscape full of airports, broken hearts, wine and spilled dog chow. ...[She] delves into the shadow and still finds glimpses of light.\"--San Francisco Chronicle\n\nTracey Knapp's first full-length collection of poems, Mouth, won the 42 Miles Press Poetry Award and was published in 2015.

For two months he danced, filmed, made music, did standup comedy, wrote and much more, untill he found out what he loved doing most: making music. He uploaded a couple of tracks on Youtube and Soundcloud, and Bakermat was born. Since then he stepped in a rollercoaster ride he could have never imagined. First official single \u2018Vandaag (One Day)\u2019 became a huge hit all over Europe hitting top 10 spots in almost every country. The early succes got rewarded with platinum records in France, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. The succes was largely attributed to the fact that he came with an entirely different and new sound, combining minimal and deep house with jazz and soul. It laid a foundation for the genres we now know as \u2018tropical house\u2019 or \u2018melodic house\u2019, in which he is still seen as the founder and pioneer. He keeps trying to bring new and refreshing music out, always trying to be as unique and renewing as possible. A huge succes was his record released in 2015 \u201cTeach Me\u201d where he mixedSoul, Gospel and Disco to a record that set a new standard in the \u2018melodic house\u2019 genre. \n\nBakermat also became well know because of his innovative performances and stage hostings. He did shows in Paris, London and other big cities with an entire band called \u2018The Bakermat Live Band\u2019. In Paris he even played in the legendary L\u2019Olympia with his band, a sold out show. He played at almost every big festival there is over the last 3 years like I Love Techno, Ultra Miami, Sensation White, Mainsquare, Montreux Jazz Festival, Tomorrowland, Mysteryland, South West Four and the list goes on and on. He is also the host of stages at the biggest festivals like the \u2018Bakermat & Friends\u2019 stage at Tomorrowland every year, or the \u201cBakermat\u2019s Gospel Church\u2019 at Kingsday Festival and a lot more. As one of the founders his goal is to bring new talent or fellow colleagues to the stage and that's exactly what he does when he's curating a stage. Artists like Klingande, Thomas Jack, The Avener, Robin Schulz and Oliver Heldens are often guests at one of his stages. Bakermat\u2019s new album \u2018Bon Voyage\u2019 is his first studio album and will be released in 2015, it contains a lot of new material and new styles/ production techniques, because according to Bakermat this was an opportunity for him to \u201c really be free of restrictions and make exactly what I want\u201d. With his album, remixes, releases and confirmed shows at the biggest festivals lined up, it seems 2016 will be a great year for Bakermat once again.\n\n\nWho is Sam Feldt?\n\nDeemed a \"Modern House superstar\" by Billboard, Sam Feldt broke onto the scene in 2013 with remixes including \"On Trees and Birds and Fire\" from I Am Oak. In 2015, he released a remake of \"Show Me Love\" from Robin S. which charted highly across the world. \n\nThe Dutch DJ, born August 1, 1993, is currently signed to Spinnin' Records and most recently released \"Summer On You\", a melodic and deep tropical track with Lucas & Steve featuring Wulf.\n\nwww.PrimeSocial.com\n===============================\nGET INVOLVED: Want to get involved with PSG?

With singular insight and narrative grace, Pollack explores the moral complexities of scientific discovery through the story of a brilliant research biologist facing heartrending decisions about her personal life and the fate that genetics may have preordained for her. \n\nJane Weiss is a young post doc at MIT who is obsessed with finding the genetic marker for Valentine\u2019s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that killed her mother. With the clear vision of a scientist, she knows that she and her sister each stand a fifty percent chance of inheriting the disease, and her research is fueled by a need to discover if they are genetic carriers. Having witnessed the devastating effect that Valentine\u2019s had on her parents\u2019 marriage, Jane has vowed to steer clear of love unless she is sure she is free of the disease, refusing to become a burden on anyone else. But that determination is upended when she meets and falls in love with Willie, whose own father died of Valentine\u2019s. Suddenly, with the very real possibility of their relationship ending in tragedy, her research takes on a new ferocity.\n\n\u201cA Perfect Life probes how we live in the face of uncertainty and the ways risk can both disable and empower us. Eileen Pollack has crafted a tender exploration of family love that is as smart and thought-provoking as it is moving.\u201d--Celeste Ng, author of Everything I Never Told You\n\n\u201cLike Richard Powers\u2019s The Gold Bug Variations and Allegra Goodman\u2019s Intuition, Eileen Pollack\u2019s compelling novel offers an intimate portrait of scientists engaged in research with the potential to change all our lives\u2014and equally engaged in relationships that change their own lives.\"--Andrea Barrett, author of Ship Fever and Servants of the Map\n\n\u201cA tense scientific mystery propels this gripping novel, but what resonates most powerfully are the keenly observed discoveries Jane makes about even deeper mysteries: the risks and pleasures of being human, and the nuances\u2014as well as the costs\u2014of love.\u201d--Kim Edwards, author of The Memory-Keeper's Daughter\n\nWith both an MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and a BS in physics from Yale, Eileen Pollack is uniquely positioned to have written A Perfect Life, bringing both a fiction-writer\u2019s sensibility and a scientific background to the novel. She is the author of two previous novels, two story collections, and two books of nonfiction, and has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Michener Foundation and the Rona Jaffe Foundation. Her work has been included in both the Best American Short Stories and the Best American Essays series. Pollack has been a professor at the Helen Zell MFA Program at the University of Michigan since 1999, and was a director of the program for five years. She now divides her time between Ann Arbor and Manhattan.", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/310581899312138/", "date": "2016-09-21T19:00:00-04:00"}]
