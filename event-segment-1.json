Holding guards and civilian employees hostage, during the next four long days and nights the inmates negotiated with state officials for improved living conditions. On September 13, the state abruptly ended talks and sent many hundreds of heavily armed state troopers and corrections officers to retake the prison by force. In the ensuing gunfire, thirty-nine men were killed--hostages as well as prisoners--and close to one hundred were severely injured. Over the following hours, days, and weeks, troopers and officers brutally retaliated against the prisoners. For decades afterward, instead of charging any state employee who had committed murder or carried out egregious human rights abuses, New York officials only prosecuted the prisoners and failed to provide necessary support to the hostage survivors or the families of any of the men who'd been killed. \ufffd\ufffd     \n\nHeather Ann Thompson sheds new light on one of the most important civil rights stories of the last century, exploring every aspect of the uprising and its legacy from the perspectives of all of those involved in this forty-five year fight for justice: the prisoners, the state officials, the lawyers on both sides, the state troopers and corrections officers, and the families of the slain men.\n\nHeather Ann Thompson is an award-winning historian at the University of Michigan. She has written on the history of mass incarceration as well as its current impact for The New York Times, Time Magazine, The Atlantic, Salon, Dissent, New Labor Forum, and The Huffington Post. She served on a National Academy of Sciences blue-ribbon panel that studied the causes and consequences of mass incarceration in the United States and has given Congressional Staff briefings on this subject. Thompson is also the author of Whose Detroit: Politics, Labor and Race in a Modern American City and editor of Speaking Out: Protest and Activism in the 1960s and 1970s.", "name": "Heather Ann Thompson", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/245238912538964/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-20T19:00:00-04:00", "description": "Arbor Brewing Company presents...\nACOUSTIC TUESDAYS!\nEvery Tuesday at 7pm, we\u2019ll be featuring live acoustic sets from the area\u2019s most talented artists.\n\nJames Cornelison\nChicago Native James Cornelison has been working as a multi-instrumentalist in Michigan for 5 years.

UM Zell Fellow in Poetry Kayla Krut will open for Leila and Tracey.\n\nLeila Chatti is a Tunisian-American poet. She holds a BA from Michigan State University and an MFA from North Carolina State University. The recipient of a fellowship from the Fine Arts Work Center, a scholarship from the Tin House Writers\u2019 Workshop, and prizes from Narrative Magazine\u2019s 30 Below Contest, the Gregory O'Donoghue International Poetry Prize, and the Academy of American Poets, her poems appear in Best New Poets, Narrative, Boston Review, North American Review, The Missouri Review, TriQuarterly, Gulf Coast, and elsewhere. www.leilachatti.com\n\n*\n\nThe poems in Tracey Knapp's Mouth are about the world of the mouth and its many satellites. Words, especially. And when you're lucky, another mouth. The poems address the beautiful failures of language to mean what it says, and to be less than the physical. At the end of the day, you are left with only the words in your head, the mouth on your face.\n\n\"Quotidian, weird, intimate, witty, and skittery, Knapp's poems are refractions through a funhouse mirror. They're self-conscious without being self-important. The wounded heart is everywhere apparent; we of that tribe can be grateful for one more of us to voice it, brilliantly. MOUTH is a charmer of a first book. Read it and weep over your nachos and wine; it will leave you wanting more.\"\u2014Kim Addonizio\n\n\"...part Frank O\u2019Hara, part Robert Herrick ...it\u2019s a book that hurts, and a book that flirts... It\u2019s also part of the least self-important, and therefore the most important, tradition of lyric, the tradition of trying to make the tiny moments, their delights and disappointments, last.\"--Stephen Burt, Slate\n\n\"Deliciously irreverent, Knapp\u2019s poems welcome us into a weird urban landscape full of airports, broken hearts, wine and spilled dog chow. ...[She] delves into the shadow and still finds glimpses of light.\"--San Francisco Chronicle\n\nTracey Knapp's first full-length collection of poems, Mouth, won the 42 Miles Press Poetry Award and was published in 2015. Tracey has received scholarships from the Tin House Writers\u2019 Workshop and the Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Poetry Fund.  Her work has been anthologized in Best New Poets 2008 and 2010, The Cento: A Collection of Collage Poems (Red Hen Press), and has appeared in Poetry Daily, Five Points, Ink Node (as a featured poet),The National Poetry Review, Red Wheelbarrow Review, The New Ohio Review, The Minnesota Review, and elsewhere.", "name": "Leila Chatti & Tracey Knapp", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/739176996220270/"}, {"source": "Facebook", "date": "2016-09-20T21:00:00-04:00", "description": ">>TICKETS: http://samfeldtnectonightclub.eventbrite.com/?aff=FBE\n\nPrime Social Group presents...\n\nBAKERMAT x SAM FELDT\n=============================\nNECTO NIGHTCLUB\n=============================\nTuesday, September 20 // 9:00 PM doors // 18+\n=============================\n\n>>TICKETS ON SALE: http://samfeldtnectonightclub.eventbrite.com/?aff=FBE\n\n>>>MUSIC: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/bakermatmusic/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/samfeldt\n\nWho is Bakermat?\n\nIt all started in 2012 when 20 year old Lodewijk Fluttert took a semester off of hisstudy Psychology to discover different sides of himself. For two months he danced, filmed, made music, did standup comedy, wrote and much more, untill he found out what he loved doing most: making music. He uploaded a couple of tracks on Youtube and Soundcloud, and Bakermat was born. Since then he stepped in a rollercoaster ride he could have never imagined. First official single \u2018Vandaag (One Day)\u2019 became a huge hit all over Europe hitting top 10 spots in almost every country. The early succes got rewarded with platinum records in France, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. The succes was largely attributed to the fact that he came with an entirely different and new sound, combining minimal and deep house with jazz and soul. It laid a foundation for the genres we now know as \u2018tropical house\u2019 or \u2018melodic house\u2019, in which he is still seen as the founder and pioneer. He keeps trying to bring new and refreshing music out, always trying to be as unique and renewing as possible. A huge succes was his record released in 2015 \u201cTeach Me\u201d where he mixedSoul, Gospel and Disco to a record that set a new standard in the \u2018melodic house\u2019 genre. \n\nBakermat also became well know because of his innovative performances and stage hostings. He did shows in Paris, London and other big cities with an entire band called \u2018The Bakermat Live Band\u2019. In Paris he even played in the legendary L\u2019Olympia with his band, a sold out show. He played at almost every big festival there is over the last 3 years like I Love Techno, Ultra Miami, Sensation White, Mainsquare, Montreux Jazz Festival, Tomorrowland, Mysteryland, South West Four and the list goes on and on. He is also the host of stages at the biggest festivals like the \u2018Bakermat & Friends\u2019 stage at Tomorrowland every year, or the \u201cBakermat\u2019s Gospel Church\u2019 at Kingsday Festival and a lot more. As one of the founders his goal is to bring new talent or fellow colleagues to the stage and that's exactly what he does when he's curating a stage. Artists like Klingande, Thomas Jack, The Avener, Robin Schulz and Oliver Heldens are often guests at one of his stages. Bakermat\u2019s new album \u2018Bon Voyage\u2019 is his first studio album and will be released in 2015, it contains a lot of new material and new styles/ production techniques, because according to Bakermat this was an opportunity for him to \u201c really be free of restrictions and make exactly what I want\u201d. With his album, remixes, releases and confirmed shows at the biggest festivals lined up, it seems 2016 will be a great year for Bakermat once again.\n\n\nWho is Sam Feldt?\n\nDeemed a \"Modern House superstar\" by Billboard, Sam Feldt broke onto the scene in 2013 with remixes including \"On Trees and Birds and Fire\" from I Am Oak. In 2015, he released a remake of \"Show Me Love\" from Robin S. which charted highly across the world. \n\nThe Dutch DJ, born August 1, 1993, is currently signed to Spinnin' Records and most recently released \"Summer On You\", a melodic and deep tropical track with Lucas & Steve featuring Wulf.\n\nwww.PrimeSocial.com\n===============================\nGET INVOLVED: Want to get involved with PSG?
