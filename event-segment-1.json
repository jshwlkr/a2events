Recording for the first time as a solo artist and writing without what he refers to as \"the shackles of genre\", the direction is really a culmination of the variety in his past projects. The sound is still very much grounded in American Roots music but is unbound by the narrow concepts he has applied to previous outings. \n\nRyan Racine first made a name for himself as the front man of Ann Arbor\u2019s rockabilly outfit Lucky Haskins. Formed when he was only 15, the band burst onto the metro Detroit rockabilly scene and quickly garnered attention and a loyal fan base. Besides introducing the genre to a whole new generation in the area, they earned spots opening for legends like Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Lee Rocker as well as a slot in the 1995 Detroit Music Awards.\n\nNever a cover\nAlways a good time", "name": "Acoustic Tuesdays: Ryan Racine", "date": "2016-05-17T19:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/227229244321687/", "description": "Spring has arrived, semeters are ending... come celebrate with us.

The ones that got him killed. She's not crazy, okay? She just doesn't have a whole lot of respect for staying alive.\n\nJaycee doesn't expect to have help on her insane quest to remember Jake. But she's joined by a group of unlikely friends all with their own reasons for completing the dares and their own brand of dysfunction: the uptight, ex-best friend, the heartbroken poet, the slacker with Peter Pan syndrome, and... Mik. He doesn't talk, but somehow still challenges Jayce to do the unthinkable-reveal the parts of herself that she buried with her brother.\n\nCori McCarthy's gripping narrative defies expectation, moving seamlessly from prose to graphic novel panels and word art poetry, perfect for fans of E.
