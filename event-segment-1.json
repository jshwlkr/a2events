This event will take place next door in the tap room at Arbor Brewing Company, with the bar open for business! Both books will be available for purchase.\n\nWhile in recent years Detroit\u2019s craft beer scene has exploded with activity and innovation, brewing has a long history in the Motor City. Small brewers popped up during the mid-1800s to support nearby saloons. Many breweries survived the dry years by producing \u201cnear beer,\u201d or non-alcoholic beer, which was quickly abandoned after Prohibition. Consolidation marked the following decades until only Stroh Brewery Company remained. Local brewing returned triumphantly with dozens of breweries opening their doors since the 1990s, including Motor City Brewing Works, Atwater Brewery and Kuhnhenn Brewing Company. \n\nStephen Johnson is the owner and founder of Motor City Brew Tours, a tour company that provides guided tours to Michigan breweries. He is also an adjunct professor of marketing at Macomb Community College and has worked in both sales and marketing for over twenty years. Stephen earned a bachelor\u2019s in business from Western Michigan University and a master\u2019s of business administration from Walsh College of Business. A Michigan native, Stephen loves to share his knowledge and history of Detroit the beer scene.\n\nDavid Bardallis is the author of Ann Arbor Beer: A Hoppy History of Tree Town Brewing, and a former beer columnist for the Ann Arbor News an MLive.

When their father has to travel to a distant city for work, the brothers take advantage of his absence to skip school and go fishing. At the forbidden nearby river, they meet a madman who persuades the oldest of the boys that he is destined to be killed by one of his siblings.
