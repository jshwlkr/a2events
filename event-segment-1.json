Zafir explores the commonalities of music born in the cultural centers of Iraq and Syria that blew like the wind (zafir) across the waters of the Mediterranean to Al-Andalus. There it blended with elements of Spanish music and was brought back across the seas to North Africa, where it flourished in the cities of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Zafir features virtuoso composer and musical director Simon Shaheen with his group Qantara, acclaimed singer Nidal Ibourk, flamenco musician Juan P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez, and the fiery young flamenco dancer Auxi Fernandez, who completes the music with her explosive footwork. \n\nMore info: http://ums.org/performance/zafir-simon-shaheen/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/419604171550681/", "date": "2016-04-15T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Pointless Improv with Trap Queens and Demon Death Stab", "description": "These shows are completely improvised, and star an impressive cast of experienced local improvisers, including our resident company The League of Pointless Improvisers.\n\nGroup 1: \"Trap Queens\" starring Annie Hendricks and Cari Sue Murphy\n\nGroup 2: \"Demon Death Stab\" starring Julia Schroeder, James Quesada, Steve Vagts, Nuverre Naami, Travis Pelto, Aaron Mondry, Andy Reid, and Anna Imesch\n\nGroup 3: \"The League of Pointless Improvisers\" starring Corene Ford, Erik Heilner, Matt Swartz, Mitch Socia, and Jason Valentini", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1183566044989707/", "date": "2016-04-15T20:00:00-04:00"}, {"source": "Facebook", "name": "Scott Ainslie at Green Wood Coffee House", "description": "Scott Ainslie came of age during the Civil Rights era, and cultivated a powerful affinity for cross-cultural exchange.
